## 1. EXERCISE SCIENCE FOUNDATIONS

### 1.1 Nervous System Architecture & Motor Control

**Key Data:**
- Average human brain: ~86 billion neurons + 1 trillion glial cells
- Spinal axons: up to 1 meter long, just 100 microns (1/10,000 mm) wide
- Signal transmission speed: up to 90+ meters per second (via myelinated axons)
- 12 pairs cranial nerves (to brain), 31 pairs spinal nerves (to spinal cord)
- 43 total pairs of peripheral nerves

**Protocol:**
- Nervous system coordinates movement via 6 core functions:
  1. Coordinates movement (plans, initiates, asserts control)
  2. Processes sensory input (smell, vision, taste, hearing, somatosensory)
  3. Initiates life-sustaining functions (find water, food, mate)
  4. Learns and forms memories (primary elements of cognition)
  5. Experiences emotions (fear, pleasure, attachment, drive)
  6. Controls arousal (consciousness, sleep regulation)

**Neuron Types & Motor Control:**
- Motor neurons transmit commands from brain/spinal cord to muscles and glands
- Sensory neurons transmit information to brain and spinal cord (movement, sight, touch, sound, smell)
- Interneurons create circuits between sensory/motor neurons
- Neuromuscular junction: acetylcholine release triggers muscle contraction cascade
- Muscle spindle: sensory receptor in muscle belly detecting length changes and regulating contraction
- Myelin sheath: fatty insulation around axon allowing rapid signal transmission (90+ m/s), breakdown = multiple sclerosis

**Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):**
- Sympathetic: "fight or flight" response via norepinephrine release
- Parasympathetic: "rest and digest" response balancing sympathetic
- Homeostasis: maintained by ANS balance for heart rate, breathing, digestion

### 1.2 Muscular System — Anatomy, Physiology & Growth Triggers

**Key Data:**
- Skeletal muscle is largest component of kinesiology and human movement
- Three muscle fiber types with distinct characteristics:

| Fiber Type | % Force | Fatigue Resistance | Twitch Speed | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type I (Slow Oxidative) | 40-50% | Very High (oxidative) | Slow | Endurance |
| Type IIa (Fast Oxidative-Glycolytic) | 40-50% | High | Fast | Mixed training |
| Type IIx (Fast Glycolytic) | Up to 50% | Low | Very Fast | Strength/Power |

**Muscle Fiber Types & Functional Characteristics:**
- Type I fibers: slow-twitch, high mitochondrial density, fatigue-resistant (aerobic metabolism)
- Type IIa fibers: fast-twitch, oxidative-glycolytic, moderate fatigue resistance
- Type IIx fibers: fast-twitch, glycolytic, low fatigue resistance, highest force production

**Muscle Size Changes (Muscle Growth Triggers):**
- Mechanical tension (primary): heavy loads creating high force demands
- Metabolic stress: lactate accumulation, pump sensation, hypoxia
- Muscle damage: microtrauma from eccentric contractions and novel stimuli
- Protein synthesis elevation required for hypertrophy (via mTOR pathway)
- Progressive overload: increasing weight, volume, density, or intensity

**Muscle Actions:**
- Concentric: muscle shortens under tension (lifting phase)
- Eccentric: muscle lengthens under tension (lowering phase, highest force capability)
- Isometric: no length change, static contraction

**Muscle Attachments:**
- Origin: attachment point that does not move (proximal)
- Insertion: attachment point that moves (distal)
- Agonist: primary mover
- Antagonist: opposes agonist action
- Synergist: assists agonist
- Stabilizer: stabilizes joint during movement

### 1.3 Energy Systems (ATP-PC, Glycolytic, Oxidative)

**Key Data:**

| Energy System | Duration | Intensity | Fuel Source | ATP Replenishment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ATP-PC (Phosphocreatine) | 0-10 seconds | Maximal (>90% 1RM) | Creatine phosphate | Immediate, high power |
| Glycolytic (Lactate) | 30 sec-2 min | High (75-90% max) | Blood glucose, glycogen | Rapid, moderate power |
| Oxidative (Aerobic) | 2+ minutes | Moderate-Low (50-75% max) | Fat, carbohydrate, protein | Sustained, endurance |

**ATP-PC System (Alactic):**
- Powers maximal strength and power efforts (0-10 seconds)
- Creatine phosphate regenerates ATP via phosphate donation
- Full recovery: 3-5 minutes for 95% restoration, 5-10 minutes for 100%
- Zero lactate production (alactic)

**Glycolytic System (Lactate):**
- Primary system for high-intensity efforts (30 sec-2 min)
- Anaerobic glycolysis: glucose/glycogen → pyruvate → lactate
- Lactate accumulation accompanies high effort (not "lactic acid" toxin but metabolic byproduct)
- Optimal for strength endurance training (6-12 reps)
- Recovery: 5-10 minutes at low intensity

**Oxidative System (Aerobic):**
- Dominates efforts >2 minutes
- Most efficient ATP production (30-32 ATP per glucose)
- Requires oxygen: glucose/glycogen/fat → acetyl-CoA → TCA cycle → electron transport chain
- Allows sustained activity with minimal lactate
- Limited by VO2max, mitochondrial density, fat oxidation capacity

### 1.4 Skeletal System & Joint Mechanics

**Key Data:**

**Bone Functions:**
- Support and structure
- Protection of organs
- Calcium and phosphorus storage
- Red marrow: blood cell production
- Yellow marrow: fat storage

**Joint Structure:**
- Articulation: where bones meet
- Cartilage: smooth surface for frictionless movement
- Synovial fluid: lubricates joint
- Ligaments: bone-to-bone connective tissue (limit range)
- Tendons: muscle-to-bone connective tissue (transmit force)

**Joint Classification (by Movement Capability):**
1. Immovable (fibrous): skull joints
2. Slightly movable (cartilaginous): vertebral discs
3. Freely movable (synovial): knee, shoulder, hip, ankle
   - Ball-and-socket: greatest ROM (hip, shoulder)
   - Hinge: single plane movement (knee, elbow)
   - Condyloid: multiple planes (wrist)
   - Pivot: rotation (atlantoaxial joint)
   - Gliding: flat surfaces (carpal bones)
   - Saddle: selective rotation (thumb CMC)

**Anatomical Planes of Movement:**
- Sagittal plane: forward/backward (flexion/extension)
- Frontal plane: side-to-side (abduction/adduction)
- Transverse plane: rotation (internal/external rotation)

## 2. TRAINING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 SAID Principle & Specificity

**Definition:** Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands — body adapts specifically to the training stimulus applied

**Core Principle:**
- Training must match sport/goal specificity (strength training ≠ endurance training adaptation)
- Overload stimulus determines adaptation type:
  - Heavy loads → strength adaptation
  - High velocity → power adaptation
  - High volume → hypertrophy adaptation
  - High repetitions → endurance adaptation

**Application Examples:**
- Strength athlete: train 1-6 reps @ 80-95% 1RM
- Hypertrophy athlete: train 6-12 reps @ 65-85% 1RM
- Endurance athlete: train high volume @ 50-75% 1RM
- Power athlete: train low reps (1-5) at high velocity with adequate recovery

**Maps to:** periodization_progression.md, training_splits.md

---

### 2.2 Overload, Progression & Reversibility

**Progressive Overload Mechanisms:**
1. **Increase Load (Weight):** +5-10% when able to perform prescribed reps cleanly
2. **Increase Volume:** +2-5 reps per set or +1-2 sets per exercise
3. **Decrease Rest Period:** reduce rest 15-30 seconds between sets
4. **Increase Frequency:** add 1 session per week (if recovery allows)
5. **Improve Tempo:** slow eccentric (2-3 sec), faster concentric (1-2 sec)
6. **Improve Density:** same volume in less time (circuits, supersets)

**Progression Guidelines:**
- Strength: increase load 2-5% when target reps achieved
- Hypertrophy: increase volume 2-10% weekly (reps, sets, or load)
- Endurance: increase duration or intensity gradually (5-10% per week)
- Power: maintain high velocity; don't sacrifice speed for load

**Reversibility (Detraining):**
- Strength loss: 1-3 weeks without training minimal loss; 4+ weeks significant decline
- Muscle mass: begins 2-3 weeks post-training cessation
- Cardiovascular: VO2max declines ~10% after 2-4 weeks without endurance training
- Neuromuscular adaptation (CNS): retained longer than muscle/cardio adaptations
- Prevention: 1-2 sessions/week maintenance prevents rapid deconditioning

### 2.3 Individualization & Program Customization

**Assessment Baseline:**
- Current fitness level (strength, endurance, body composition)
- Movement quality and limitations
- Sport/performance goals
- Injury history and risk factors
- Available training time and frequency
- Equipment access and environment
- Psychological readiness and motivation

**Programming Variables Modified by Individual:**
- Starting intensity (relative to current 1RM or fitness level)
- Rep ranges and load progressions
- Exercise selection (based on joint health, equipment)
- Frequency (recovery capacity, schedule constraints)
- Duration and deload frequency (age, training age, stress levels)

**Special Considerations:**
- Age: younger athletes can handle higher frequency; older require longer recovery
- Training age: novices progress faster on simpler programs; advanced need varied stimuli
- Genetics: responders vs. non-responders to specific training stimuli
- Nutrition and sleep: must match training intensity and volume

## 3. PERIODIZATION MODELS

### 3.1 Linear Periodization

**Definition:** Systematic, progressive reduction in volume with increasing intensity over training cycle

**Periodization Structure:**
- **Macrocycle:** 1 year or full training season
- **Mesocycle:** 4-12 weeks (training phase with specific goal)
- **Microcycle:** 1 week (workouts and daily sessions)

**Linear Model Progression (Typical 12-Week Hypertrophy-to-Strength Block):**

| Week | Phase | Reps | Load (%1RM) | Rest (min) | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | Hypertrophy | 8-12 | 65-80% | 60-90s | Build muscle mass |
| 5-8 | Strength | 5-8 | 80-90% | 2-3 min | Build strength base |
| 9-12 | Power | 1-5 | 85-95% | 3-5 min | Peak strength/power |

**Weekly Volume Progression (Example):**
- Week 1: 3 sets × 12 reps @ 70% = 36 reps (hypertrophy)
- Week 4: 4 sets × 10 reps @ 75% = 40 reps (more intensity)
- Week 8: 5 sets × 5 reps @ 85% = 25 reps (less volume, more intensity)
- Week 12: 3 sets × 3 reps @ 90% = 9 reps (peak strength)

**Advantages:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Progressive overload easy to track
- Clear adaptation timeline

**Limitations:**
- Single quality focus per phase (may neglect other adaptations)
- Detraining in non-trained qualities (power lost during hypertrophy phase)
- May not suit advanced athletes who need concurrent training

### 3.2 Undulating (Daily/Weekly) Periodization

**Definition:** Intensity and volume vary within same week to train multiple adaptations concurrently

**Daily Undulating (DUP) Example (3-Day Split):**

| Workout | Reps | Load (%1RM) | Volume | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1 (Monday) | 8-10 | 70-75% | High | Hypertrophy |
| Day 2 (Wednesday) | 5-6 | 82-88% | Moderate | Strength |
| Day 3 (Friday) | 2-4 | 90-95% | Low | Power |

**Weekly Undulating Example (4-Day Upper/Lower Split):**

| Session | Day | Reps | Load | Rest | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upper Hypertrophy | Mon | 8-12 | 70-80% | 60-90s | Volume |
| Lower Power | Tue | 3-5 | 85-95% | 3-5 min | Explosiveness |
| Upper Strength | Thu | 5-6 | 82-88% | 2-3 min | Strength |
| Lower Hypertrophy | Fri | 8-12 | 70-80% | 60-90s | Volume |

**Advantages:**
- Trains multiple adaptations in same microcycle
- Reduced risk of detraining non-trained qualities
- Variation prevents plateau and CNS overuse
- Athletes retain strength/power while building muscle

**Limitations:**
- Requires careful programming to prevent CNS overuse
- More complex to track progress
- Recovery must be prioritized (quality sleep, nutrition)

### 3.3 Block Periodization

**Definition:** Focused 3-4 week blocks emphasizing one quality, then switching to next quality

**12-Week Block Model:**

| Block | Weeks | Focus | Reps | Load | Goal | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accumulation | 1-4 | Hypertrophy | 8-12 | 65-80% | Volume base | Muscle fiber recruitment |
| Intensification | 5-8 | Strength | 3-5 | 85-95% | CNS adaptation | Max strength |
| Realization | 9-12 | Power/Peaking | 1-3 | 90-95% @ high velocity | Sport-specific | Peak performance |

**Within-Block Progression (3-Week Accumulation Block):**

| Week | Sets × Reps | Load | Exercise Variation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 × 12 | 70% | Standard variation |
| 2 | 4 × 10 | 75% | Increased volume |
| 3 | 4 × 8 | 80% | Increased intensity |

**Advantages:**
- Clear focus reduces decision-making
- Cumulative fatigue managed via short blocks
- Preparation phase builds capacity for intensity
- Used successfully in Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting

**Limitations:**
- High fatigue at end of intensity block requires deload
- Risk of losing hypertrophy/endurance adaptations
- Requires longer training cycle (12+ weeks) for all qualities

---

### 3.4 Conjugate Periodization (Concurrent Training)

**Definition:** All qualities (strength, power, hypertrophy, endurance) trained simultaneously via different exercises and methods

**Weekly Split Example (3-Day Concurrent):**

| Session | Max Effort | Speed | Rep | Accessory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | Heavy Bench (1-5 @ 85-90%) | Box Jump (3 × 3) | DB Rows (8-10) | Biceps, Triceps |
| Day 2 | Heavy Squat (1-5 @ 85-90%) | Speed Deadlift (5 × 2 @ 75%, fast) | Leg Press (8-10) | Hamstring, Quad |
| Day 3 | Speed Bench (5 × 5 @ 60%, explosive) | Heavy Incline (3-5 @ 85%) | Pulls (6-8) | Core, Lats |

**Core Principles:**
- Max Effort: build absolute strength (1-5 reps @ 80-95%)
- Speed/Dynamic: maintain speed, train explosiveness (3-5 reps @ 50-70% with max velocity)
- Rep Work: hypertrophy (6-12 reps @ 70-85%)
- All in same week, different days

**Exercise Rotation (3-4 Week Blocks):**
- Change max effort exercise every 3 weeks (bench → close-grip → pin press)
- Prevents accommodation to same lift
- Addresses weak points in lift (sticking points)
- Maintains movement variety

**Advantages:**
- Retains all qualities simultaneously (no detraining)
- High frequency for sports (2-3 sessions/week)
- Exercise variation prevents plateau
- Ideal for seasonal athletes with competition dates

**Limitations:**
- Complex programming requires expertise
- High frequency, but lower volume per exercise
- CNS demands require impeccable recovery
- Better for advanced athletes with training age >3 years

## 4. TESTING & ASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS

### 4.1 1-Repetition Maximum (1RM) Testing

**Definition:** Maximum weight an individual can lift for one repetition with proper form

**1RM Testing Protocol:**

**Pre-Test Requirements:**
- Medical clearance (especially for older/injured populations)
- 48+ hours since last heavy training
- Adequate warm-up (critical for safety and valid results)

**Warm-Up Protocol (5-10 minutes):**
1. 5-10 min light cardio (treadmill, rower) to elevate heart rate
2. Dynamic stretching (5-10 reps each: arm circles, leg swings, torso rotations)
3. Specific warm-up sets:
   - Set 1: 5 reps @ 40-50% estimated 1RM
   - Set 2: 3 reps @ 60-70% estimated 1RM
   - Set 3: 2 reps @ 80% estimated 1RM
   - Rest 2-3 minutes before 1RM attempts

**1RM Testing Progression:**
- Attempt 1: 90% estimated 1RM (should be achievable)
- Rest: 3-5 minutes
- Attempt 2: 95-100% estimated 1RM (heavy attempt)
- Rest: 3-5 minutes
- Attempt 3: 102-105% estimated 1RM (max attempt, if previous successful)
- Continue in 2-3% increments until failure
- Success = lift completed with proper form
- Limit to 5 total attempts

**1RM Estimation Formula (Epley):**
- 1RM = Weight × (1 + Reps/30)
- Example: 225 lbs × 5 reps = 225 × (1 + 5/30) = 225 × 1.167 = 263 lbs estimated 1RM

**Valid 1RM Criteria:**
- Proper form throughout lift (no bouncing, partial ROM)
- Complete range of motion (full descent/ascent)
- No assistance from spotter
- Single attempt (not multiple attempts in series)

**Safety Considerations:**
- Spotter on hand (especially bench press)
- Safeties set properly for squat/bench
- Clear area of obstacles
- No distractions during attempt
- Stop immediately if form breaks down

### 4.2 Maximal Strength Assessment (Additional Tests)

**3-Repetition Max (3RM) Alternative:**
- Less intimidating than 1RM for novices
- Similar strength estimate: 3RM × 1.09 ≈ estimated 1RM
- Lower injury risk while maintaining validity
- Example: 225 lbs × 3 = ~245 lbs estimated 1RM

**Rep Max Testing (1-10RM Estimation):**

| Reps Completed | Load | Estimated 1RM |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100% 1RM | Known |
| 2 | 95% 1RM | Load × 1.06 |
| 3 | 93% 1RM | Load × 1.09 |
| 4 | 90% 1RM | Load × 1.13 |
| 5 | 87% 1RM | Load × 1.17 |
| 6 | 85% 1RM | Load × 1.21 |
| 8 | 80% 1RM | Load × 1.31 |
| 10 | 75% 1RM | Load × 1.43 |

### 4.3 VO2max & Aerobic Capacity Assessment

**Definition:** Maximum amount of oxygen body can utilize during maximal effort (mL/kg/min)

**VO2max Testing Methods:**

**Method 1: Maximal Treadmill Test (Gold Standard)**
- Equipment: Treadmill with speed/incline control, heart rate monitor, optional gas analyzer
- Duration: 8-12 minutes to exhaustion
- Protocol: Start 2.5-4 mph, increase speed/incline every minute until volitional failure
- Measurement: HR at peak, RPE, estimated VO2max via prediction equation
- Validity: Direct VO2 measurement via gas analysis most accurate; prediction formulas ±10-15% variance

**VO2max Prediction (No Gas Analysis):**
- Astrand-Rhyming Submaximal Test: cycle ergometer at steady-state HR
- Cooper 12-Minute Run Test: distance covered = VO2max estimation
- Balke-Ware 1-Mile Walk Test: time + HR used in prediction equation

**Cooper 12-Minute Run Test (Field Test):**
- Protocol: Run/walk as far as possible in 12 minutes on measured track
- VO2max = (distance in miles × 35.97) - 11.29
- Example: 1.5 miles in 12 min = (1.5 × 35.97) - 11.29 = 42.7 mL/kg/min
- Validity: ±10-15% variance from lab testing
- Advantage: requires only track, no equipment

**Typical VO2max Values (Sedentary to Elite):**

| Population | VO2max (mL/kg/min) |
|---|---|
| Sedentary adult male | 25-35 |
| Sedentary adult female | 20-27 |
| Recreationally active male | 35-45 |
| Recreationally active female | 27-35 |
| Endurance athlete male | 50-70+ |
| Endurance athlete female | 40-60+ |
| Elite marathon runner | 70-85 |

## 5. PROGRAM DESIGN — ACUTE VARIABLES

### 5.1 Training Volume, Intensity & Density

**Key Definitions:**

**Intensity (Load):**
- Percentage of 1RM or difficulty level (RPE 1-10)
- Controls adaptation type:
  - 50-70% 1RM: endurance, hypertrophy base
  - 70-85% 1RM: hypertrophy primary
  - 85-95% 1RM: strength, power primary
  - 95%+ 1RM: maximal strength, singles

**Volume:**
- Total repetitions × weight lifted in session/week
- Calculation: Sets × Reps × Weight = Volume (in pounds/kg)
- Example: 4 sets × 8 reps × 225 lbs = 7,200 lbs total volume
- Hypertrophy requires higher volume: 8-15 total sets per muscle group per week
- Strength requires lower volume: 4-8 total sets per muscle group per week
- Power: 3-6 total sets per lift per week (quality over quantity)

**Weekly Volume Targets by Goal:**

| Goal | Volume (Reps) | Sets per Muscle | Load (%1RM) | Exercise Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Endurance | 8-12 reps × 12-20 sets | 12-20 | 50-70% | 2-3×/week |
| Hypertrophy | 8-12 reps × 8-15 sets | 8-15 | 70-85% | 2-3×/week |
| Strength | 3-5 reps × 4-8 sets | 4-8 | 85-95% | 1-2×/week |
| Power | 1-5 reps × 3-6 sets | 3-6 | 75-90% (speed focus) | 1-2×/week |

**Density (Volume per Time):**
- Completing same volume in less time = increased density
- Methods: reduce rest periods, superset exercises, circuit training
- Density increases metabolic stress (hypertrophy stimulus)
- Example: 3 sets × 10 reps in 15 min vs. 20 min = increased density

### 5.2 Rep Ranges & Training Effect

**Rep Range Chart (Training Adaptations):**

| Reps | Load | Rest (min) | Primary Adaptation | Secondary | Training Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-3 | 90-95%+ | 3-5 | Maximal Strength | CNS | Very high force |
| 3-5 | 85-90% | 2-4 | Strength + Power | Hypertrophy | High force, some muscle |
| 5-8 | 80-85% | 2-3 | Strength + Hypertrophy | Endurance | Balanced |
| 8-12 | 70-80% | 1-2 | Hypertrophy | Metabolic stress | Muscle growth |
| 12-15 | 60-75% | 1-1.5 | Muscular Endurance | Metabolic stress | Moderate intensity |
| 15-20 | 50-70% | 45-60s | Muscular Endurance | Aerobic capacity | Low intensity |

**Rep Range Examples by Sport/Goal:**

| Goal | Reps × Sets | Load | Total Reps/Set | Example |

### 5.3 Rest Periods (Recovery Between Sets)

**Rest Period Guidelines by Goal:**

| Goal | Load | Rest Duration | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strength | 85-95% 1RM | 3-5 min | Allow ATP-PC resynthesis (95% recovery) |
| Strength-Hypertrophy | 80-85% 1RM | 2-3 min | Balance intensity with volume |
| Hypertrophy | 70-80% 1RM | 60-90 sec | Metabolic stress + lactate accumulation |
| Muscular Endurance | 50-70% 1RM | 30-60 sec | High metabolic demand |
| Power | 75-90% 1RM | 2-3 min | Allow CNS recovery, maintain velocity |

**Rest Period Details:**

**Strength Focus (85-95% load):**
- 3-5 minutes between heavy sets
- Allows 95% ATP-PC restoration (creatine phosphate system recovery)
- Permits nervous system (CNS) recovery for next rep quality
- Example: Squat 3 × 3 @ 90% with 4 min rest = peak strength

**Hypertrophy Focus (70-80% load):**
- 60-90 seconds between sets
- Creates metabolic stress (lactate, H+ ions, cell swelling)
- Maintains moderate weight despite fatigue (cumulative tension)
- Example: Dumbbell Row 4 × 10 @ 75% with 75 sec rest = muscle growth

**Power Focus (75-90% load):**
- 2-3 minutes between sets
- Allows velocity maintenance (avoid CNS fatigue-induced slowness)
- Prevents power loss from lactate accumulation
- Example: Box Jump 4 × 3 with 3 min rest = maintain explosiveness

**Endurance Focus (50-70% load):**
- 30-60 seconds between sets
- High metabolic demand, rapid lactate accumulation
- Creates training effect on aerobic capacity and work capacity
- Example: Leg Press 3 × 15 @ 65% with 45 sec rest = muscular endurance

### 5.4 Tempo (Eccentric/Isometric/Concentric Timing)

**Definition:** Speed of movement through concentric (lifting), eccentric (lowering), and isometric (pause) phases

**Tempo Notation:**
- Format: Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric-Hold (e.g., 3-1-2-0)
- Eccentric: negative/lowering phase (3 sec = slow, controlled)
- Isometric: bottom pause (1 sec = brief pause)
- Concentric: positive/lifting phase (2 sec = moderate speed)
- Hold: top pause (0 sec = no hold)

**Tempo Examples & Effects:**

| Tempo | Eccentric | Iso (Bottom) | Concentric | Use Case | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2-0-1-0 | Fast | None | Fast | Power training | CNS, speed |
| 2-1-2-0 | Controlled | Brief | Controlled | Balanced strength | Strength + hypertrophy |
| 3-1-2-1 | Slow | Pause | Controlled | Hypertrophy | Time under tension |
| 4-2-1-0 | Very Slow | Pause | Fast | Eccentric emphasis | Muscle damage |
| 1-0-3-1 | Fast | None | Slow | Metabolic stress | Lactate, pump |

**Tempo Application by Goal:**

**Strength (Power Movement Focus):**
- 2-0-1-0: squat, bench, deadlift
- Example: Lower 2 sec, no pause, explode up 1 sec = fast, powerful

**Hypertrophy (Time Under Tension):**
- 3-1-2-1: barbell compounds, moderate isolation
- Example: Lower 3 sec, pause 1 sec, lift 2 sec, pause 1 sec = 7 sec per rep
- 10 reps × 7 sec = 70 seconds mechanical tension per set

**Eccentric Emphasis (Muscle Damage):**
- 4-1-1-0: isolation exercises, mechanical drop sets
- Example: 4 sec negative on cable fly = high eccentric tension, muscle damage

**Metabolic Stress:**
- 1-0-3-1: isolation, pump work
- Example: 1 sec drop, 3 sec lift, 1 sec hold = metabolic demand

**Endurance (Work Capacity):**
- 2-0-2-0: light loads, high reps, moderate speed
- Example: 15-20 reps with controlled tempo, minimal rest

**Total Time Under Tension (TUT) for Hypertrophy:**
- Target: 40-60 seconds per set
- Example: 10 reps × 3-1-2-1 tempo = 70 sec (adequate)
- Example: 12 reps × 2-0-2-0 tempo = 48 sec (adequate)
- Too short (<30 sec): insufficient stimulus
- Too long (>90 sec): fatigue-limited, risk of form breakdown

### 5.5 Exercise Order & Programming Sequence

**Principle:** Order exercises to maximize quality and safety

**General Exercise Order Guidelines:**

1. **Warm-Up (10-15 minutes total):**
   - 5-10 min light cardio (heart rate elevation, core body temp increase)
   - Dynamic stretching (5-10 reps: arm circles, leg swings, torso rotations, cat-cow)
   - Specific warm-up sets for first exercise (per 1RM testing protocol)

2. **Power/Explosive Exercises First (Fresh CNS):**
   - Olympic lifts, jumps, throws: require maximum neuromuscular recruitment
   - Performed when CNS fresh (3-5 sets, full recovery between)
   - Example: Box Jump 4 × 3, then Squat 4 × 8

3. **Strength Exercises Second (Heavy Compounds):**
   - Barbells lifts requiring heavy load and good form
   - Bench, Squat, Deadlift, Row, Overhead Press
   - Performed after power work but before fatigue
   - Example: Bench Press 4 × 5 @ 85%

4. **Accessory/Isolation Last (Tolerate Fatigue):**
   - Single-joint movements: curls, flyes, leg extensions
   - Can be performed with higher fatigue
   - Example: Dumbbell Curl 3 × 10, Cable Fly 3 × 12

**Full Program Example (Lower Body):**

| Order | Exercise | Purpose | Sets × Reps | Load |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Warm-up | Preparation | 3 sets | Progressive |
| 2 | Box Jump | Power | 4 × 3 | 60-70% effort |
| 3 | Barbell Back Squat | Strength | 4 × 5 | 85% 1RM |
| 4 | Barbell RDL | Hypertrophy-Strength | 3 × 8 | 80% 1RM |
| 5 | Leg Press | Hypertrophy | 3 × 10 | 75% 1RM |
| 6 | Leg Curl | Isolation | 3 × 12 | 70% 1RM |

**Rest-Pause Superset Example (Hypertrophy Focus):**
- Barbell Bench Press (main) + Dumbbell Fly (accessory)
- Bench: 4 × 8 @ 80%, rest 90s
- Fly: 3 × 12 @ 70%, rest 45s
- Benefit: Volume increase, time efficiency, metabolic stress

**Alternating Sets (Upper Body):**
- Barbell Row (Pull) + Barbell Bench (Push)
- 4 sets, alternate exercises, minimal rest between pairs
- Example: Bench 4 reps, rest 30s, Row 4 reps, rest 2 min (full pair cycle)
- Benefit: CNS recovery for opposite muscle groups, time efficiency

### 5.6 Training Frequency & Muscle Group Split Options

**Frequency Definitions:**
- **Frequency:** training sessions per week (total or per muscle group)
- **Higher frequency:** allows volume distribution, adequate recovery per session
- **Lower frequency:** requires higher volume per session, longer recovery needed

**Training Frequency Guidelines by Experience Level:**

| Level | Total Sessions/Week | Frequency per Muscle | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Novice | 3 | 3×/week (full-body) | Lower volume, faster recovery |
| Intermediate | 4 | 2×/week (upper/lower split) | Balanced volume + recovery |
| Advanced | 5-6 | 2-3×/week (split varies) | High volume, require variation |

**Split Options:**

**Full-Body Split (3 days/week):**
- Best for: Novices, strength focus, time-limited
- Sessions: Mon, Wed, Fri (48h recovery)
- Volume per muscle: ~6-8 sets/session

Example Session:
```
- Lower Body Compound (Squat): 4 × 5 @ 85%
- Upper Body Push (Bench): 4 × 5 @ 85%
- Upper Body Pull (Row): 4 × 5 @ 85%

### 5.7 Deloading & Recovery

**Definition:** Planned reduction in volume/intensity to allow full recovery and prevent overtraining

**Deload Frequency:**
- Every 4-6 weeks (after accumulation block)
- Sooner if CNS fatigue signs appear (strength loss, poor motivation, elevated resting HR)
- Duration: 1 week (typical) or 1-2 weeks (if deep fatigue)

**Deload Protocol (Typical):**
- Reduce volume 40-50% (e.g., 3 sets × 8 reps → 3 sets × 4 reps)
- Maintain intensity: same load, fewer reps
- Maintain movement patterns: same exercises
- Maintain frequency: same sessions/week

Example Deload Week (Upper/Lower):
```
Upper (Regular Week): 3 × 5 @ 85%, 3 × 8 @ 80%, 3 × 10 @ 75% = 37 sets
Upper (Deload):       2 × 3 @ 85%, 2 × 5 @ 80%, 2 × 6 @ 75% = 18 sets (49% volume)

Lower (Regular): 4 × 5 @ 85%, 3 × 8 @ 80%, 3 × 10 @ 75%, 3 × 12 @ 70% = 39 sets
Lower (Deload):  2 × 3 @ 85%, 2 × 5 @ 80%, 2 × 6 @ 75%, 2 × 8 @ 70% = 20 sets (51% volume)
```

**Deload Signs (When to Pull Back):**
- Strength loss >5% despite training
- Persistent joint pain or inflammation
- Elevated resting heart rate (+5-10 bpm above baseline)
- Poor motivation, depression, mood issues
- Sleep disruption despite adequate attempt
- Persistent fatigue despite sleep

**Recovery Components (Off-Session):**
1. Sleep: 7-9 hours nightly (critical for strength, muscle protein synthesis)
2. Nutrition: adequate protein (0.7-1g per lb bodyweight), calories match goal
3. Stress management: meditation, deep breathing, limit stressors
4. Light activity: 10-30 min low-intensity cardio, walking, mobility work
5. Hydration: 0.5-1 oz per lb bodyweight daily

## 6. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

### 6.1 Youth Training (Prepubescent to Adolescent)

**Age Categories:**

| Age | Development | Training Focus | Cautions |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6-9 years | Prepubescent | Skill, movement patterns, play-based | Avoid heavy loads |
| 10-12 years | Preadolescent | Sport-specific skills, body awareness, light resistance | Avoid peak loads |
| 13-15 years | Adolescent | Strength foundation, periodization, increased loads | Monitor growth spurts |
| 16-18 years | Late adolescent | Adult-style training, intensity increase | Skeleton maturation varies |

**Youth Training Principles:**

**Strength Training Safety (Ages 10+):**
- Focus on technique and movement quality over load
- Bodyweight exercises first (push-ups, pull-ups, lunges)
- Light loads (50% adult intensity), higher reps
- Progression: increase reps before increasing load
- No heavy singles or near-maximal attempts until late teens
- Example: Bodyweight Squat 3 × 15, progressing to goblet squat with light weight

**Frequency & Duration:**
- Ages 6-9: Play-based activity, 3×/week, 30-45 min total
- Ages 10-12: 2-3 sessions/week, 45-60 min, mixed modalities
- Ages 13-15: 3-4 sessions/week, 60-90 min, sport-specific + strength
- Ages 16-18: 4-5 sessions/week, 90-120 min, sport periodization

**Exercise Selection (Youth-Appropriate):**
- Bodyweight exercises: push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, planks
- Bodyweight variations: incline push-ups, assisted pull-ups
- Light dumbbells/kettlebells: controlled movement priority
- Resistance bands: variable resistance, joint-friendly
- Avoid: heavy barbells until late teens, high-impact plyometrics until maturity

**Growth Plate Considerations:**
- Growth plates (epiphyses) are weaker than adult bone
- Avoid heavy compressive/shear loads during growth spurts
- Monitor for pain at joint extremities
- Emphasis on controlled movement, bodyweight foundation
- Heavy barbell training typically safe 16+ years with supervision

### 6.2 Older Adult Training (Age 60+)

**Age-Related Changes:**
- Sarcopenia (muscle loss): 3-8% per decade after age 30; accelerates after 60
- Bone density loss: 1-3% per year post-menopause (females), post-65 (males)
- Reduced flexibility: connective tissue stiffness increases
- Slower recovery: need longer rest periods, more frequent deloads
- Higher injury risk: joints more fragile, tendons less resilient

**Older Adult Training Principles:**

**Frequency & Volume:**
- 2-3 sessions/week, 60-90 min (including warm-up/cool-down)
- Lower volume per session, higher frequency tolerance
- Example: 3×/week full-body at lower intensity > 2×/week high volume

**Load & Intensity:**
- 60-80% 1RM primary range (vs. 70-95% for younger)
- 10-15 reps per set (higher reps, lower intensity)
- Emphasis on control and form over load progression
- No heavy singles or near-maximal attempts
- Example: Barbell Squat 3 × 12 @ 65% 1RM (vs. 4 × 5 @ 85% for younger)

**Exercise Modifications:**
- Reduce range of motion if needed (safety, joint health)
- Increase stability aids: use smith machine, TRX, machine weights
- Bodyweight variations before loaded versions
- Example: Seated chest press before standing barbell bench

**Recovery & Rest Periods:**
- Rest 2-3 minutes between heavy sets (vs. 3-5 for younger)
- Total rest between sessions: 48h minimum (vs. 24-36h younger)
- Deload every 4-6 weeks (same as younger)

**Health & Safety Screening:**
- Pre-exercise medical clearance recommended (age 60+)
- Blood pressure monitoring (especially on strength days)
- Joint health assessment, ROM evaluation
- Gradual progression (2-4 week foundation phase)

**Benefits of Strength Training (60+):**
- Maintains muscle mass, prevents sarcopenia
- Improves bone density (slows osteoporosis)
- Increases metabolic rate (helps weight management)
- Improves balance and fall risk reduction
- Maintains independence for daily tasks (stairs, carrying, lifting)
- Improves quality of life and longevity

### 6.3 Pregnant & Postpartum Training

**Pregnancy (Trimester Breakdown):**

| Trimester | Adaptation | Training Guidelines |
|---|---|---|
| 1st (0-12 wks) | Rapid hormonal change, nausea possible | Maintain pre-pregnancy program if fit |
| 2nd (13-26 wks) | Expanding belly, increased laxity | Reduce intensity, modify positions |
| 3rd (27-40 wks) | Weight gain (25-35 lbs), center of gravity shift | Lower intensity, short sessions, walking focus |

**Pregnancy Training Principles:**

**Safe Exercise Parameters:**
- Intensity: 50-70% 1RM or RPE 4-6/10 (perceived exertion, not maximal)
- Duration: 20-30 min per session, 3-4×/week
- Avoid: heavy loads (>80% 1RM), Valsalva maneuver (breath holding)
- Continue: walking, swimming, modified strength, flexibility

**Exercise Modifications:**
- Avoid supine exercises (3rd trimester): increases blood pooling
- Avoid abdominal compression: heavy compounds modified
- Reduce ROM if needed: prevent overstretching (relaxin hormone increases laxity)
- Reduce impact: elliptical/swimming over running

Example Pregnancy Workout (2nd Trimester):
```
- Walk 5-10 min warm-up
- Modified Goblet Squat 2 × 12 @ 50% effort (lighter, wider stance)
- Wall Push-Up 2 × 10 (vs. full push-ups)
- Seated Row 2 × 12 @ 60% 1RM (vs. bent-over)
- Glute Bridge 2 × 12 (vs. deadlift)
- Stretching 5-10 min
- Total: 30-40 minutes
```

**Postpartum (6+ weeks after delivery):**

**Progressive Return to Training:**
- Weeks 0-6: Rest, pelvic floor recovery, walking only
- Weeks 6-12: Medical clearance, start low-impact activity, pelvic floor assessment
- Weeks 12-24: Gradual strength introduction, avoid heavy abdominal work, diastasis recti check
- Week 24+: Return to full training as recovery allows

**Postpartum Modifications:**
- Pelvic floor dysfunction common: focus on pelvic floor PT initially
- Diastasis recti (abdominal separation): modify core work, avoid heavy compression
- Reduced intensity initially: 50-70% pre-pregnancy 1RM
- Progressive loading: increase 5% weekly if tolerated
- Return timeline: 12-24 months for full training volume/intensity (varies by individual)

### 6.4 Injured & Rehabilitation Training

**Injury Phase Progression:**

| Phase | Timeline | Characteristics | Training Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acute | 0-3 days | Pain, swelling, inflammation | Rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) |
| Early Subacute | 3-7 days | Pain decreasing, early motion | Gentle ROM, pain-free movement |
| Late Subacute | 1-3 weeks | Moderate pain reduction | Progressive ROM, light strengthening |
| Remodeling | 3-12+ weeks | Pain minimal, strength building | Gradual load increase, sport-specific |

**Rehabilitation Training Principles:**

**Pain-Free Movement Priority:**
- All exercises should be pain-free or minimal discomfort (<3/10 pain scale)
- If exercise causes pain, modify or regress
- Progress by increasing ROM, then load, then complexity

**Progressive Resistance (Injured Limb):**
- Phase 1: Isometric holds (no joint movement, pain reduction)
- Phase 2: Gentle ROM with bodyweight or band assistance
- Phase 3: Resistance band, light weight (2-5 lb dumbbells)
- Phase 4: Progress to normal strength training loads (50-70% 1RM)

**Example Knee Rehabilitation (ACL Post-Surgery):**

Week 1-2 (Acute/Early Subacute):
```
- Quad sets (quadriceps contraction): 3 × 15, hold 5 sec
- Glute sets: 3 × 15, hold 5 sec
- Straight leg raise: 2 × 10 (pain-free)
- Bed-supported ROM: 10 min, 2×/day
- Walking assist: 2-3 × daily, limited distance
```

Week 4-6 (Late Subacute):
```
- Standing quad sets: 3 × 15
- Mini squat (0-45°): 3 × 10 (bodyweight)
- Step-ups (small step): 2 × 10
- Side-lying hip abduction: 3 × 12
- Resistance band walks (lateral): 2 × 15
- Walking: 20-30 min daily (pain-free pace)
```

Week 8-12 (Remodeling):
```
- Bodyweight Squat: 3 × 8-10 (full ROM if pain-free)
- Goblet Squat: 3 × 10 @ light load (5-10 lbs)
- Step-ups: 3 × 10 (higher step)
- Leg Press: 3 × 12 @ 50% normal load
- Lunges: 2 × 8 per side (if pain-free)
- Light plyometrics if appropriate: jump rope, controlled hops
```

**Return-to-Sport Criteria:**
- Pain-free ROM in injured joint
- Strength ≥90% of uninjured side (tested via 1RM, max isometric, or functional test)
- Proprioception normalized (balance testing)
- Sport-specific movement patterns: pain-free, controlled
- Medical clearance from healthcare provider

- More accurate: submaximal HR test or lab test

**Exercise Selection Frequency (per muscle group per week):**
- 2 sessions/week: optimal for most goals (strength, hypertrophy)
- 1 session/week: minimal but effective (time-limited, general fitness)
- 3 sessions/week: higher frequency, lower volume per session (advanced)

### 7.4 Training Age & Experience Recommendations

**Training Age Definitions:**

| Level | Training Age | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Novice | 0-1 year | New to structured resistance training |
| Intermediate | 1-3 years | Consistent training, basic proficiency |
| Advanced | 3-5+ years | Sophisticated programming, technical skill |
| Elite | 5+ years, specialized | Sport-specific, optimized performance |

**Program Complexity by Training Age:**

| Level | Program Type | Frequency | Complexity | Progression Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Novice | Full-body | 3×/week | Simple, 3-4 exercises | Fast (5-10% load increase) |
| Intermediate | Upper/Lower | 4×/week | Moderate, 8-10 exercises | Moderate (2-5% load increase) |
| Advanced | PPL or conjugate | 5-6×/week | Complex, 12-16 exercises | Slow (2-3% load increase) |

**Progression Expectations (Strength Training):**
- Novice: 5-10% strength gain per week (first 4-8 weeks, newbie gains)
- Novice: 2-5% strength gain per week (weeks 8-24)
- Intermediate: 1-3% strength gain per month
- Advanced: 0.5-2% strength gain per month
- Elite: 0.5-1% strength gain per month (maintenance or small gains)

**Muscle Gain Expectations (Hypertrophy Training):**
- Novice: 0.5-1 lb per week (3-6 months, with proper nutrition)
- Intermediate: 0.25-0.5 lb per week (1-2 years in)
- Advanced: 0.1-0.25 lb per week (3+ years in)
- Note: gains slow significantly after first 1-2 years; newbie advantage real
