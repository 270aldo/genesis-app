## Key Frameworks & Models

### Training Status Progression Model
- **Beginner (0-3 years training):** Foundation phase, compound emphasis, full-body 3-4x/week
- **Intermediate (3-7 years training):** Specialization emergence, varied rep ranges, 4-6 sessions/week
- **Advanced (7+ years training):** Expertise consolidation, high specificity, 5-10 sessions/week (often split across days)

**Maps to:** `periodization_progression.md` (athlete_level_classification)

### Strength vs. Hypertrophy Divergence Framework

#### Beginner Protocols
- **Rep Range:** Mostly 5-10 reps, prioritize compound basics
- **Focus:** Technical proficiency > load progression
- **Volume:** Hard but not maximal, train full body 3-4x/week
- **Key Difference from Hypertrophy:** Beginners emphasize technique foundation in lower rep ranges; hypertrophy phase uses higher volumes

**Maps to:** `training_splits.md` (beginner_strength_focus)

#### Intermediate Protocols
- **Rep Schemes:** Mostly sets of 5-10 reps; occasional sets of 3-6 for strength testing
- **Exercise Selection:** Troubleshoot Specific Force (SFR) — test various exercises to identify which give best force output
- **Intensity Range:** RPE 7-10 from Minimum Effective Volume (MEV) to Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV)
- **Training Frequency:** Each movement pattern 2-4x per week across 4-6 total sessions
- **Volume Cycling:** Train from MEV to MRV within each mesocycle
- **Key Difference from Hypertrophy:** Strength athletes vary rep ranges week-to-week and manage fatigue within the week; hypertrophy maintains consistent higher reps

**Maps to:** `training_splits.md` (intermediate_strength_split)

#### Advanced Protocols
- **Rep Schemes:** Mostly sets of 3-6 reps; only use 5-10 rep sets when reclaiming size or moving up weight class
- **Exercise Selectivity:** Focus on Specific Force Representatives (SFR) with highest RSM (Raw Stimulus Magnitude) — highest stimulus with least fatigue
- **Intensity Range:** RPE 8-9 for most work; RPE 10 only rare occasions due to extreme fatigue and injury risk
- **Training Frequency:** Each movement pattern 2-3x per week across 5-10 sessions (often split across multiple daily sessions)
- **Fatigue Management:** Advanced athletes vary rep ranges and movements to manage fatigue within the week; may use twice-per-day sessions in a phasic manner
- **Key Difference from Hypertrophy:** Advanced strength athletes prioritize RSM (stimulus per unit fatigue) over absolute volume; they optimize movement selection ruthlessly

## Quantitative Data & Specific Protocols

### Rep Range Prescription by Level

| Training Level | Primary Rep Range | Secondary Rep Range | Testing Rep Range | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Beginner** | 5-10 reps | N/A | Rare | Full body 3-4x/week |
| **Intermediate** | 5-10 reps | 3-6 reps (occasional) | 1-3 reps (not peak too often) | 2-4x per movement, 4-6 total sessions |
| **Advanced** | 3-6 reps | Minimal 5-10 reps | 1-3 reps (phasic) | 2-3x per movement, 5-10 total sessions |

**Maps to:** `training_splits.md` (rep_range_assignment_by_level)

### Load Progression Rules

**Key Data:**
- **Weekly Load Increase:** Increase RPE by 1-point on the RPE scale OR add 5-10-15 lbs per week (movement dependent)
- **Ramp-Up Protocol:** Never increase more than 1 RPE point from week prior; in most cases increase by 5, 10, or 15 pounds
- **Load Deload:** Approximately every 4-8 weeks, or when fatigue symptoms emerge

**Protocol:**
1. Establish baseline load (working up from warm-up sets)
2. Add weight conservatively week-to-week (5-15 lbs typical)
3. Do NOT skip deload periods; deloads allow complete fatigue recovery
4. If training with overlapping soreness, do NOT add more sets or volume
5. If technique begins to fail, pause load progression and consolidate

**Source Context:** Chapter 14 — Preventing and Managing Injuries; Ramp up loads slowly section

**Maps to:** `training_splits.md` (load_progression_algorithm)

---

### Minimum Effective Volume (MEV) to Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV) Model

**Key Data:**
- **MEV:** The least amount of sets/reps per muscle group per week that produces strength adaptation
- **MRV:** The most volume a trainee can recover from within a mesocycle
- **Optimal Training Zone:** Train from MEV moving toward MRV across 4-week mesocycles
- **Intermediate Mandate:** Train from MEV to MRV in most mesocycles (breaking barriers at end)
- **Advanced Mandate:** Manage fatigue more aggressively; reduce volume when fatigue stalls; use deloads phasically

**Protocol:**
1. Begin mesocycle near MEV (minimal effective sets for the lift)
2. Add sets each week (increase frequency or sets-per-session)
3. Track fatigue markers (soreness, sleep quality, mood, RPE perception)
4. Stop volume increases when approaching MRV (usually 3-4 weeks in)
5. Transition to deload mesocycle (30-50% normal volume for 1 week)
6. Resume new cycle at new baseline (typically higher than previous MEV)

**Maps to:** `periodization_progression.md` (mesocycle_volume_management)

### Specific Force Representative (SFR) & Raw Stimulus Magnitude (RSM) Framework

**Key Data:**
- **SFR (Specific Force Representative):** An exercise that produces the highest force output for a given muscle group or movement pattern in a trainee
- **RSM (Raw Stimulus Magnitude):** The stimulus value of an exercise = strength output WITHOUT the fatigue cost
- **SFR Selection:** Test multiple exercises within a movement pattern; choose those with highest SFR for that person
- **Advanced Principle:** Prioritize exercises with highest RSM (best stimulus-to-fatigue ratio); this is paramount for advanced trainees

**Protocol:**
1. Intermediate athletes: Try different exercises within a movement to find best personal SFRs
2. Advanced athletes: Quantify RSM by comparing rep strength across exercises and fatigue cost
3. Prioritize exercises with highest RSM; work around the resulting fatigue
4. If exercise has high RSM but high fatigue, keep it prioritized; reduce other movement volumes instead
5. Re-test SFR selections every 8-12 weeks as strength improves

### Fatigue Management & Training Stress Accumulation

**Key Data:**
- **Weekly Fatigue Ceiling:** Advanced athletes often hit physiological ceiling in 1 session; must split across days
- **Mesocycle Fatigue Arc:** Fatigue accumulates linearly week-1 → week-3, then accelerates into week-4
- **Deload Rationale:** 30-50% volume reduction for 1 week resets fatigue to baseline, maintains strength
- **Overlapping Soreness Rule:** If muscle is still sore from previous session, do NOT add more sets or volume
- **Sleep Requirement:** 7-9 hours optimal for strength recovery; insufficient sleep severely limits gains

**Protocol:**
1. Track fatigue symptoms (muscle soreness, joint soreness, grip fatigue, mood, sleep quality)
2. Avoid overlapping soreness on same muscle groups in consecutive sessions
3. Plan deloads every 4-6 weeks depending on athlete level and fatigue perception
4. If fatigue accumulates too fast, reduce load progression rate or add extra rest day
5. Ensure 7-9 hrs sleep; prioritize sleep quality over training volume

## Exercise Prioritization Protocols

### 6-Point Lift Prioritization System

**When specializing on specific lifts** (e.g., prioritizing deadlift), use this hierarchy:

1. **Hypertrophy Phase First:** Begin with hypercaloric hypertrophy phase for supporting musculature (e.g., triceps for bench press)
   - This builds muscle size which creates stronger base

2. **Increase Frequency:** Train prioritized lift one extra session per week (e.g., 2x → 3x)
   - Add dedicated sessions, don't reduce other movement volumes proportionally

3. **Reduce Other Volumes:** Lower training volume on non-prioritized lifts proportionally
   - Example: To prioritize deadlift, reduce posterior chain work in other exercises (heavy squatting volume)

4. **Prioritize Timing:** Train prioritized lift first (hardest) in most sessions when freshest
   - Example: If prioritizing deadlift but always squat first, conflict of interest exists

5. **Training Day Strategy:** Train prioritized lift earliest/hardest after days off
   - Example: If taking Sunday off, train prioritized lift on Monday morning (hardest day)

6. **Exercise Selection — RSM Priority:** Choose exercises with highest RSM for prioritized lift; SFRs with best fatigue profiles for others
   - Example: Deficit deadlifts boost deadlift RSM but high fatigue; use lower-RSM accessory squats to compensate

**Source Context:** Chapter 13 — How Do You Prioritize Specific Lifts?

**Maps to:** `training_splits.md` (lift_prioritization_protocol)

### Exercise Selection Criteria

**Key Data:**
- **SFR Requirement:** Exercise must produce high force output for trainee (personal SFR, not textbook best)
- **RSM Optimization:** For advanced athletes, RSM (stimulus per unit fatigue) > absolute stimulus
- **Technique Stability:** Lift must feel safe and buildable for that person's leverages
- **Fatigue Budget:** Account for total system fatigue, not just target muscle fatigue

**Protocol:**
1. Test multiple exercises within each movement pattern (squat variants, bench variants, deadlift variants)
2. Rank exercises by personal SFR (which one feels strongest at given RPE)
3. Verify exercise doesn't cause joint pain or poor positioning for your leverages
4. Select exercise with highest RSM if advanced; highest SFR + safe technique if beginner/intermediate
5. Commit to technique consistency; don't switch exercises week-to-week unless poor SFR
6. Re-test SFR rankings every 8-12 weeks (strength curves change, leverages adapt)

## Nutrition & Diet Integration for Strength

### Diet Matching to Training Phase

**Key Data:**
- **Hypertrophy Phase:** Caloric surplus (eat more); prioritize muscle gain over fat minimization
  - Only gain muscle in caloric surplus during hypertrophy blocks
  - Otherwise unnecessary fat gain occurs

- **Early Strength Phase:** Can diet down (slight deficit), but with constraints
  - Never exceed 0.5% body weight loss per week to minimize strength loss
  - Reduce load progressions by ~50% if cutting to avoid excessive fatigue accumulation

- **Peaking/Late Strength Phase:** Maintain weight and calories
  - Keep leverages consistent (same weight = same strength levers)
  - Cutting weight late in strength block severely increases fatigue and injury risk
  - Weight loss dieting makes fatigue reduction much harder (physiologically more demanding)

- **Maintenance Phases:** Normalize calories to sustain strength without gaining/losing

**Protocol:**
1. Gain muscle during hypertrophy blocks (surplus, maintenance protein ~0.7-1g per lb)
2. If must diet during strength phase, cap at 0.5% bodyweight loss/week
3. Reduce load progression by half (example: 5 lbs → 2.5 lbs increments) during cutting
4. Maintain weight during peaking; never lose weight in final weeks before competition
5. Plan weight loss phases AFTER peaking phases, during recovery/transition

## Injury Prevention & Management

### 4 Core Injury Prevention Rules

**Rule 1: Don't Be an Idiot**
- Always warm up properly; keep technique clean
- Avoid gym challenges and random heavy lifting
- Never jump loads beyond conservative progression (multiple weeks ahead)
- Tons of people injured by reaching beyond progressive advancement

**Rule 2: Ramp Up Loads Slowly**
- Add maximum 1 RPE point per week (e.g., RPE 6 → RPE 7)
- In pounds: increase 5, 10, or 15 lbs typical (movement dependent)
- Never add 45 lbs just because "it feels right"
- Being patient reduces injury risk notably

**Rule 3: Pay Attention**
- If technique hurts joints more with each rep/set, pause set, rack weight, reevaluate
- Make adjustments if form becomes painful (don't power through)

**Rule 4: Deload Maturely**
- Don't skip deloads; your body literally needs recovery to heal
- Deloads are easy and low-volume; boring but necessary
- Don't add volume during deload thinking you can train
- If deload isn't "easy," it's not much of a deload, and next mesocycle fatigue will accumulate much faster
- Skipping deload causes fatigue to spike faster than anticipated

### Injury Management Protocol (6 Steps)

**For Acutely Injured Area:**

1. **Medical Clearance:** See medical professional; follow all surgery/rehab guidance exactly

2. **Pain-Free Range Initiation:** Once cleared for activity
   - Sets of 20-30 reps at RPE 5-10 (very light)
   - Work full pain-free range of motion
   - End when entire ROM achieved pain-free

3. **Volume Tolerance Build:** Pain-free tissue, light loading
   - 3-0 RIR (rate of intended reps) in handful of sets of 20-30 reps
   - 2-3 sessions per week (NOT 3-4 sessions)
   - Recently injured tissue has poor volume tolerance

4. **Range Expansion into Load:** Still pain-free, higher load
   - Add sets and cycle from MEV to MRV in 20-30 rep range
   - Only when comfortably recovering from 20-30 rep sets

5. **Load Increase into Strength Range:** Gradual load addition
   - Slowly add load to reach 10-20 rep range
   - Increase by 2-3 reps per session, not by 10RM jumps
   - Example: don't jump from 30RM to 10RM; gradually reduce reps

6. **Return to Strength Range & Deload:** Once pain-free in higher rep ranges
   - Slowly add load to 5-10 rep range
   - Eventually dip back to 5-10 rep peaking as comfort allows
   - Take deload after returning to normal training range

## Troubleshooting Lack of Strength Progress

### 8-Factor Diagnostic Framework

**Factor 1: Appropriate & Consistent Training/Diet**
- **Issue:** Inconsistent training or inconsistent eating prevents gains accumulation
- **Diagnostic:** Are you completing tidy sequences of workouts over weeks/months? Are you eating similarly day-to-day?
- **Fix:** Lock in consistency first; gains only manifest after weeks of completed training + nutrition

**Factor 2: MEV to MRV Training Across Muscle Groups**
- **Issue:** Unknown if hitting Maximum Recoverable Volume for target muscles
- **Diagnostic:** Example: Are you hitting MRV at end of squat accumulation phases? Do you know if squats need more volume?
- **Fix:** Increase sets every mesocycle of block until strength stalls. You may need 3-6 reps of sets; don't assume you're doing "enough"
- **Detail:** Only see strength gains after deload brings fatigue down; not in the mesocycle itself. Judge volume sufficiency by testing after deload.

**Factor 3: Fatigue Management & Sleep**
- **Issue:** Insufficient sleep (< 7 hrs), high stress, or poor recovery
- **Diagnostic:** Are you getting 7-9 hours? Is stress high? Can you unwind regularly?
- **Fix:** Rest and recovery are critically important for strength. Prioritize sleep; strength gains plateau without it.

**Factor 4: Exercise Selection for Personal SFR/RSM**
- **Issue:** Exercises chosen don't produce high force for that person
- **Diagnostic:** Are you using exercises with best SFR for your leverages? Do other exercises produce more strength?
- **Fix:** Test alternative exercises. Don't complain about lagging lifts if you haven't tested higher-SFR accessory work.
- **Example:** Lagging squat strength despite high hack squat RSM? Maybe do 5-10 rep hack squats instead of more front squats.

**Factor 5: Finding Stable Technique for Best Lift Numbers**
- **Issue:** Switching techniques week-to-week prevents technique mastery
- **Diagnostic:** Does your technique feel confident and repeatable? Or are you experimenting constantly?
- **Fix:** Commit to one technique variation for 4-6 weeks. Strength regain is easy; strength gain happens in familiar territory.
- **Detail:** If not progressing on a lift, try different technique slightly; worst case you're at same spot. Best case you find better technique.

**Factor 6: Hypercaloric Gain Phases & Muscle Building**
- **Issue:** Not enough muscle mass = not enough force-producing tissue
- **Diagnostic:** Have you looked at champion lifters? Nearly all are mega-jacked. Are you lean for weight class or just light?
- **Fix:** Add muscle size. Most straightforward path to strength is to add muscle size. Do hypertrophy phases; eat surplus; build bigger muscles.

**Factor 7: Training-Side Fatigue Management**
- **Issue:** Fatigue accumulation (deloads, active rests, low-volume phases) not built into program
- **Diagnostic:** Do you deload every 4-6 weeks? Do you have low-volume phases?
- **Fix:** Take deloads or active rests. Common "instant PR" formula = deload + fresh nervous system. Few weeks later, "crazy strength gains" occur.

**Factor 8: Long-Term Implementation Duration**
- **Issue:** Changes implemented for days/weeks, not months
- **Diagnostic:** Have you stuck with a plan for months? Or did you change it every few weeks?
- **Fix:** Really want best results? Try implementing troubleshooting tips for months. At that point, gains will likely return.
- **Detail:** Too many people unwilling to make temporarily thankless commitment. If you resist that temptation, you push limits further.

## Differences from Hypertrophy Training

### Core Divergences

| Factor | Strength Training | Hypertrophy Training |
|--------|---|---|
| **Primary Rep Range** | 3-6 reps (advanced), 5-10 reps (intermediate/beginner) | 6-12 reps, 8-15 reps common |
| **Exercise Selection** | Highest RSM (stimulus per fatigue); personal SFR | Highest MMC (mind-muscle connection); volume tolerance |
| **Training Frequency** | High frequency per muscle (2-4x/week movement pattern) | Moderate frequency (1-2x/week muscle group) |
| **Volume Strategy** | MEV to MRV over mesocycle; aggressive fatigue management | High volume throughout; weekly volume peaks accumulate |
| **Load Progression** | Weekly load increases RPE 1-point or 5-15 lbs | Moderate load increase; volume increase emphasis |
| **Peaking Periodization** | Explicit peaking blocks (concentrated low-rep work); competition prep | Gentle deload weeks; no extreme peaking |
| **Intensity (Load %)** | High intensity % (RPE 8-10 common) | Moderate-high intensity (RPE 6-8 common) |
| **Fatigue Tolerance** | Lower tolerance; fatigue managed phasically; deloads frequent | Higher tolerance; extended high-volume blocks |
| **Technique Variability** | Stable technique within block; minimal variation week-to-week | Varied rep ranges, tempos, angles for MMC |
| **Caloric Requirement** | Strength gains in deficit (carefully); especially in late phases | Surplus required for optimal hypertrophy |
| **Nervous System Focus** | Central nervous system adaptation paramount (force output) | Muscular adaptation (size); neural secondary |
