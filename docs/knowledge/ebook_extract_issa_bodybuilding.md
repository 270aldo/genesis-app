## 1. HYPERTROPHY SCIENCE

### Muscle Growth Mechanisms (Myofibrillar vs Sarcoplasmic)

- **Key Data:**
  - **Myofibrillar hypertrophy:** 2-8 reps, high tension, low volume, strength-focused
  - **Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy:** 8-12 reps, moderate tension, high volume, metabolic stress-focused
  - **Optimal hypertrophy rep range:** 6-12 reps per set for balanced growth
  - **Maximum hypertrophy response:** 8-12 reps with 60-85% 1RM

- **Protocol:** Bodybuilders utilize BOTH mechanisms through periodized training:
  - Strength phase (4-6 weeks): 3-5 reps, 85-90% 1RM, 2-3 min rest
  - Hypertrophy phase (6-8 weeks): 8-12 reps, 65-85% 1RM, 60-90 sec rest
  - Metabolic phase (4-6 weeks): 12-15 reps, 50-70% 1RM, 30-45 sec rest

### Satellite Cells & Muscle Fiber Hyperplasia

- **Key Data:**
  - Satellite cells activated by mechanical tension and muscle damage
  - Hyperplasia (fiber number increase) occurs with extreme volume/tension
  - Estimated 5-10% contribution to total hypertrophy (majority is hypertrophy of existing fibers)
  - Activation requires consistent progressive overload over 12+ weeks

- **Protocol:**
  - Progressive volume increase (RPE-based or 5-10 rep progression per cycle)
  - Mechanical tension minimum: 60-70% 1RM or RPE 6-7
  - Frequency: 2-3x per muscle group weekly for optimal satellite cell signaling
  - Recovery: 48-72 hours between high-tension sessions for same muscle group

### mTOR Pathway & Protein Synthesis

- **Key Data:**
  - mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) upregulation requires: mechanical tension + metabolic stress + amino acid availability
  - Peak amino acid sensing occurs at 20-40g protein per meal
  - Leucine threshold: 2.5-3g per meal to trigger mTOR activation
  - Protein synthesis peaks 24-48 hours post-training, returns to baseline by 72 hours

- **Protocol:**
  - Minimum protein intake: 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight daily (bodybuilding-specific)
  - Meal frequency: 3-5 meals distributing protein evenly (20-40g per meal)
  - Post-workout window: 0-2 hours (not critical if daily protein met)
  - Carbohydrate co-ingestion: 0.8-1.2g/kg to preserve amino acids during recovery

### Mechanical Tension vs Metabolic Stress

- **Key Data:**
  - **Mechanical Tension:** Primary driver, 60-85% 1RM, RPE 6-9, requires progressive load increase
  - **Metabolic Stress:** Secondary driver, 12-15+ reps, RPE 7-10, high lactate/metabolite accumulation
  - **Muscle Damage:** Tertiary factor, induced by volume and eccentric emphasis
  - Optimal hypertrophy: Combination of all three in cycled phases

- **Protocol (Optimal Weekly Distribution):**
  - 40% volume at high tension (3-6 reps, 85%+ 1RM)
  - 50% volume at moderate tension (6-12 reps, 65-80% 1RM)
  - 10% volume at high metabolic stress (12-20 reps, drop sets, rest-pause)

    - RPE 7: Moderate, 3 reps left, hypertrophy work
    - RPE 8-9: High, 1-2 reps left, strength + hypertrophy
    - RPE 10: Maximal effort, 0 reps left, true 1RM attempts

  - **Load Prescription:**
    - 60-70% 1RM: High reps (12-20), metabolic stress
    - 70-80% 1RM: Moderate reps (8-12), hypertrophy + strength
    - 80-90% 1RM: Low reps (3-6), strength + myofibrillar hypertrophy
    - 90%+ 1RM: 1-3 reps, competition/testing only

- **Protocol:**
  - Working sets RPE 6-8 (2-4 reps in reserve recommended for hypertrophy to manage fatigue)

  - **Tempo prescription:** 2-3 seconds eccentric, 1 second pause, 1-2 seconds concentric
  - **Minimum TUT:** 20-30 seconds (very heavy, low reps still effective)
  - **Maximum TUT:** 90+ seconds (metabolic stress, diminishing strength benefit)
  - **Set reps to achieve 40-60 sec TUT:**
    - 4-6 reps with 2-3 sec eccentric = 40-50 sec
    - 8-10 reps with 2 sec eccentric = 50-60 sec
    - 12-15 reps with 1-2 sec eccentric = 40-60 sec

- **Protocol:**
  - Primary compounds: Moderate tempo (2-1-1), allow TUT to accumulate across sets
  - Accessory work: Controlled tempo (3-1-2), emphasize 50-60 sec TUT per set
  - Dropsets/supersets: Can exceed 60 sec TUT for metabolic stimulus
  - Heavy loads (80%+ 1RM): Don't artificially slow tempo; focus on load

## 6. PERIODIZATION FOR BODYBUILDING

### Periodization Models (Macrocycle Structure)

**Linear Periodization (Strength → Hypertrophy → Metabolic)**

- **Week 1-4: Strength Phase**
  - Rep range: 3-6 reps, 85-90% 1RM
  - Rest: 2-3 minutes between sets
  - Volume: 12-16 sets per muscle per week
  - Goal: Build strength foundation, activate myofibrillar growth
  - Exercise rotation: Keep same exercises for 4 weeks

- **Week 5-8: Hypertrophy Phase**
  - Rep range: 8-12 reps, 65-80% 1RM
  - Rest: 60-90 seconds between sets
  - Volume: 16-22 sets per muscle per week
  - Goal: Maximum muscle protein synthesis, pump
  - Exercise rotation: Same exercises, increase sets/volume

- **Week 9-12: Metabolic/Conditioning Phase**
  - Rep range: 12-20 reps, 50-70% 1RM
  - Rest: 30-45 seconds between sets
  - Volume: 12-16 sets per muscle per week
  - Goal: Metabolic stress, conditioning, minor fat loss
  - Exercise rotation: New exercises for stimulus variation

- **Week 13: Deload**
  - Volume: 50% normal, RPE 5-6
  - Purpose: Nervous system recovery, connective tissue adaptation
  - Frequency: Same (2-3x per muscle)

**Block Periodization (Strength Blocks → Hypertrophy Blocks)**

- **4-Week Strength Block (A):** 4-6 reps, 85% 1RM, lower volume
- **4-Week Hypertrophy Block (B):** 8-12 reps, 70% 1RM, higher volume
- **4-Week Metabolic Block (C):** 12-15 reps, 60% 1RM, moderate volume
- **Repeat A-B-C for 12-16 weeks** (optional: A-B-C-A for 16 weeks if deloads between blocks)

**Undulating Periodization (Daily/Weekly Variation)**

- **Monday (Strength):** 4-6 reps, 85% 1RM
- **Wednesday (Hypertrophy):** 8-12 reps, 70% 1RM
- **Friday (Metabolic):** 12-15 reps, 60% 1RM
- **Benefit:** Higher frequency, daily variation prevents plateau
- **Drawback:** Requires more recovery, advanced athletes only

### Periodization Differs from Strength & Conditioning

| Factor | Strength & Conditioning | Bodybuilding Periodization |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Primary Goal** | Maximal strength, power | Muscle hypertrophy, aesthetics |
| **Rep Range** | Emphasis on 1-5 reps | Emphasis on 6-15 reps |
| **Volume Structure** | Lower volume, higher intensity | Higher volume, moderate intensity |
| **Frequency** | Often 1-2x per muscle/week | 2-3x per muscle/week |
| **Exercise Variation** | Frequent variation (stimulus) | Variation every 4-6 weeks (consistency) |
| **Deload Frequency** | Every 4 weeks | Every 4 weeks (but lighter emphasis) |
| **Rest Periods** | 3-5 minutes (CNS recovery) | 60-120 seconds (mechanical tension) |
| **TUT Emphasis** | Not prioritized | 40-60 sec per set emphasized |
| **Conditioning** | Conditional GPP work | Optional cardio (20-30 min, 2-3x/week) |
| **Comp Prep** | Sport-specific drills | Peak week water/sodium/carb cycling |

- **Key Difference:** S&C seeks strength transfer to sport; bodybuilding seeks muscle hypertrophy as primary goal.

---

### Periodization Timeline (52-Week Annual Cycle)

**PHASE 1: Off-Season Hypertrophy (Weeks 1-20, 5 months)**
- 4-week blocks: Strength → Hypertrophy → Metabolic → Deload
- Caloric surplus +300-500 cal
- Training frequency: 2-3x per muscle per week
- Volume: 15-22 sets per muscle per week

**PHASE 2: Pre-Contest (Weeks 21-40, 5 months)**
- Weeks 21-28: Moderate deficit (-300 cal), maintain volume
- Weeks 29-36: Increased deficit (-400-500 cal), slight volume reduction
- Weeks 37-40: Aggressive deficit (-500-700 cal), peak week preparation

**PHASE 3: Peak Week & Contest (Weeks 41-42, 2 weeks)**
- Week 41: Water loading + sodium cycling
- Week 42: Contest week, minimal training (posing practice only)

**PHASE 4: Recovery/Transition (Weeks 43-52, 2.5 months)**
- Caloric maintenance, light training
- Volume reduction (12-15 sets per muscle per week)
- Focus on weak points identification
- Mental recovery

### Key Periodization Principles for Bodybuilding

1. **Progressive Overload:** Increase volume 5-10% every 4 weeks
2. **Exercise Consistency:** Same exercises for 4-6 weeks before rotation
3. **Volume Cycling:** Vary weekly volume within 15-22 set range
4. **Deload Strategy:** Every 4 weeks at 50% normal volume, RPE 5-6
5. **Weak Point Priority:** Allocate 10-20% additional volume to lagging muscles
6. **Nutrient Timing:** Align macros with periodized training phases
7. **Frequency Variation:** Can adjust frequency based on recovery (advance athletes: 3x, beginners: 2x)
