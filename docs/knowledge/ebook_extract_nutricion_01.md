## CARBOHYDRATE DIGESTION & METABOLISM

### Carbohydrate Breakdown Pathway
- **Salivary Amylase** (mouth): Initiates starch breakdown into glucose, maltose, dextrins
- **Pancreatic Amylase** (small intestine): Continues breakdown from mouth
- **Intestinal Enzymes** (small intestine):
  - **Lactase**: breaks lactose → galactose + glucose
  - **Maltase**: breaks maltose → glucose units
  - **Sucrase**: breaks sucrose → glucose + fructose
- **Transport**: Simple sugars absorbed via enterocytes into bloodstream
- **Monosaccharide Transporters**: 12 GLUT transporters (GLUT1-GLUT12) facilitate glucose diffusion

**Source**: Chapter 4, "From Stomach to Small Intestine" & "Absorption Into Bloodstream"

### Glucose Absorption & Utilization
- **Post-meal glucose rise**: 10-15 minutes after eating
- **Peak time**: ~60 minutes (varies by GI and meal composition)
- **Transport to Liver**: Via portal vein (first destination for fructose, galactose, glucose)
- **Hepatic Processing**:
  - Galactose → glucose conversion
  - Fructose → breakdown for energy
  - Glucose → glycogen storage
- **Key Regulation**: Pancreas & liver regulate blood glucose via negative feedback loop (glucose thermostat)

## INSULIN & GLUCAGON REGULATION

### Insulin Mechanism
- **Definition**: Hormone secreted by pancreatic β-cells; facilitates glucose uptake
- **Action**: Binds to cell membrane insulin receptor → phosphorylation via ATP → activates GLUT4 vesicle → glucose transport via GLUT4 membrane protein
- **Function**: Removes glucose from blood → cells take up glucose for energy via glycolysis
- **Clinical**: Exercise increases GLUT4 transporter activity (same effect as insulin) → helps prevent insulin tolerance & type 2 diabetes
- **Metabolic Response**: High-GI foods increase insulin quickly; creates hypoglycemia risk shortly after (if followed by glucagon)

**Key Data**:
- Insulin is the "messenger hormone" telling cells to absorb glucose
- Exercise-induced insulin sensitivity improves glucose control without insulin requirement

### Glucagon Mechanism
- **Definition**: Pancreatic hormone that raises blood glucose
- **Trigger**: Decreased blood glucose concentration
- **Action**: Signals cells to stop using glucose & release stored glucose back to blood
- **Prevents**: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
- **Hormonal Interaction**: Both insulin & glucagon prevented by growth hormone & education (ensure adequate nutrition for brain)

**Maps to**: `nutrition_protocols.md` — Blood Sugar Stabilization

## GLYCEMIC INDEX & GLYCEMIC LOAD

### Glycemic Index (GI) Definition
- **Range**: 0-100 scale (reference: glucose = 100)
- **Classification**:
  - **Low GI**: 0-55
  - **Medium GI**: 56-69
  - **High GI**: 70+
- **Measurement**: Blood glucose rise after eating 50g carbohydrate vs. reference food
- **Clinical Significance**: Predicts blood sugar fluctuation & insulin response

### GI Determinants
1. **Type of Sugar**:
   - Glucose: GI = 100
   - Sucrose: GI = 65
   - Fructose: GI = 19
2. **Starch Structure**: Amylose/amylopectin content; high amylose = lower GI
3. **Processing**: Processed foods → higher GI than whole foods
4. **Preparation**: Longer cooking time → higher GI (e.g., pasta)
5. **Ripeness** (fruits): Unripe banana GI = 30; overripe GI = 48

### Glycemic Load (GL)
- **Formula**: (GI value × carbohydrate grams per serving) ÷ 100
- **Accounts for**: Portion size (GI alone does not)
- **Example**: Watermelon: high GI (80s) but low GL due to low carb density
- **Clinical Use**: Better predictor of actual blood glucose impact than GI alone

### GI Food Classifications
**Low Glycemic (0-55)**:
- Most non-starchy vegetables (<15)
- Low-fat yogurt (no sugar) (33)
- Whole wheat spaghetti (37)
- Apple (36), Pear (36)
- Canned chickpeas (42)
- Oat bran bread (48)

**Medium Glycemic (56-69)**:
- Canned kidney beans (52)
- Banana (53)
- Sweet potato (54)
- Brown rice (54)
- Oatmeal cookies (55)
- Whole wheat bread (68)

**High Glycemic (70+)**:
- Bagel (72)
- Corn chips (72)
- Mashed potatoes (73)
- Cherries (74)
- Doughnuts (75)
- French fries (76)
- White bread (79)
- Rice cakes (82)
- Mashed potatoes, instant (83)
- Cornflakes (84)
- Dates (100)

### GI Limitations
- Does not account for portion size (→ use GL instead)
- Combining foods changes overall meal GI
- Proteins & fats lower GI of meals (change digestion timing)
- Individual variation exists

## CARBOHYDRATES & ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE

### Energy Requirements
- **Baseline Guideline**: 40% of daily calories from net carbohydrates (carbs minus fiber)
- **Adjustment**: Based on activity level & training phase
- **Timing**: Critical for performance (properly timed carbs used quickly for energy; prevents rapid insulin rise)

### Performance Benefits
- **Glycogen Utilization**: Timed carb ingestion uses carbs for energy without rapid insulin spike
- **Prevents Glycolysis Conflict**: No glucagon suppression → muscles can contract with high performance
- **Energy Availability**: Body is active & using incoming carbs (not storing as fat)
- **Glycogen Sparing**: Proper timing maintains body's glycogen stores for endurance

### Glycogenesis (Converting Non-Carbs to Glucose)
- **Definition**: Metabolic process using non-carbohydrate substrates (proteins, fats) for glucose energy
- **When Occurs**: When glycogen is depleted or unavailable
- **Performance Impact**: Less efficient; physical performance declines; increased recovery time

### Exercise-Induced Adaptations
- **Glycogen Depletion**: Extended exercise depletes muscle glycogen
- **Gluconeogenesis**: Body uses proteins & amino acids for energy (can cause muscle loss)
- **"Hitting the Wall"**: Endurance athletes experience this during glycogen depletion
- **Prevention**: Pre-exercise & during-exercise carbohydrate (CHO) + electrolyte beverages (personalized hydration)
- **Research Finding**: Benefits of carb/electrolyte drinks clearer for exercise >90 minutes (assuming replenished pre-exercise glycogen)

### Athletic Carbohydrate Strategy
- **Cofactors**: Essential nutrients & micronutrients needed for carbohydrate metabolism
- **Holistic Approach**: Type of carbs eaten, timing of intake, nutrient cofactors all contribute to performance
- **Goal**: Maintain glycogen stores & ensure energy availability during training/competition
