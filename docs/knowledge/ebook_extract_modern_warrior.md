## Mental Performance Frameworks

### Clipping of the Ego
- **Framework:** Ego Reduction Protocol
- **Key Insight:** Peak performance requires vulnerability and honest self-assessment. The "clipping of the ego" is the foundational step that removes denial, defensiveness, and false confidence that block growth.
- **Protocol:**
  - Daily acknowledgment of weaknesses
  - Honest feedback acceptance without defensiveness
  - Reframing criticism as coaching, not character attack
  - Regular vulnerability practices (sharing struggles, asking for help)
- **Source:** Foundation section, pp. 1-10
- **Maps to:** `genesis_identity.md`, `stress_recovery.md`

### The 5 Pillars Framework
- **Framework:** Five Foundational Pillars of Warrior Mindset
- **Key Insight:** All performance is built on five interconnected pillars: Courage, Discipline, Will, Mastery, and Community. Each pillar reinforces the others.
- **Protocol:**
  - **Courage:** Face discomfort daily; take one action that scares you
  - **Discipline:** Build non-negotiable daily habits; small wins compound
  - **Will:** Practice delayed gratification; say no to distractions
  - **Mastery:** Commit to skill development; track progress obsessively
  - **Community:** Find accountability partners; give and receive support
- **Source:** Core framework, pp. 11-20
- **Maps to:** `ngx_philosophy_expanded.md`, `tracking_system.md`

### Mastering the Mindset
- **Framework:** Three-Tier Mental Toughness Model
- **Key Insight:** Mental toughness is built in three layers: Awareness → Acceptance → Action. You cannot change what you don't acknowledge.
- **Protocol:**
  - **Tier 1 (Awareness):** Daily mental scan — identify negative self-talk, fear patterns, limiting beliefs
  - **Tier 2 (Acceptance):** Journal on triggers; reframe thoughts from "I can't" to "I'm learning"
  - **Tier 3 (Action):** Execute micro-commitments despite discomfort; celebrate small wins
- **Source:** Pages 31-40
- **Maps to:** `stress_recovery.md`, `genesis_identity.md`

## Goal Setting Systems

### The Heroic 100
- **Framework:** Legacy Goal-Setting Protocol
- **Key Insight:** Beyond SMART goals, the Heroic 100 connects long-term legacy (life impact) to immediate 90-day execution cycles. Warrior mindset requires a "why" that transcends personal gain.
- **Protocol:**
  - Define 1 Legacy Goal (10+ year impact vision)
  - Break into 3 Cornerstone Goals (3-year milestones)
  - Extract 12 Quarterly Goals (90-day cycles)
  - Track 100 Daily Micro-Actions (consistent inputs)
  - Weekly review: Are daily actions moving you toward legacy?
- **Source:** Pages 21-30
- **Maps to:** `ngx_philosophy_expanded.md`, `tracking_system.md`

### The Target
- **Framework:** Goal Clarity & Alignment Diagnostic
- **Key Insight:** Most goals fail due to fuzzy clarity or misalignment with values. The Target is a visual tool that forces specificity.
- **Protocol:**
  - **Bullseye (Center):** Your 90-day obsession (ONE primary goal)
  - **Ring 1 (Red):** Three supporting goals that enable the bullseye
  - **Ring 2 (Yellow):** Habits/systems required to hit all four
  - **Ring 3 (White):** Weekly accountability check-ins
  - Review weekly; adjust rings as needed
- **Source:** Pages 41-50
- **Maps to:** `tracking_system.md`, `genesis_identity.md`

## Discipline & Habit Systems

### The 5-Day Reset Protocol
- **Framework:** Weekly Discipline Calibration
- **Key Insight:** Discipline is a muscle. One weak day spirals into a week of decay. The 5-Day Reset is a mini-season (Mon-Fri) where you execute flawlessly, then recover Saturday-Sunday.
- **Protocol:**
  - **Monday:** Set your weekly non-negotiables (3-5 keystone habits)
  - **Tue-Fri:** Execute flawlessly; no compromises
  - **Daily tracking:** Did you hit all keystone habits? (0-5 days)
  - **Saturday-Sunday:** Recovery, reflection, planning
  - **Weekly score:** Track discipline ratio (days completed / days possible)
- **Source:** Pages 51-70
- **Maps to:** `tracking_system.md`, `stress_recovery.md`

### Mastering the Mindset (Habit Stacking)
- **Framework:** Trigger → Ritual → Reward
- **Key Insight:** Habits stick when attached to existing routines. The warrior builds a "ritual stack" that compounds identity change.
- **Protocol:**
  - Identify 3 existing anchors (e.g., morning coffee, lunch, bedtime)
  - Stack ONE micro-habit to each (2-5 min rituals)
  - First 21 days: Track completion daily
  - Weeks 4-8: Layer a second habit to each anchor
  - Weeks 9-12: Test if habits are automatic
  - Monthly: Rotate stacks to prevent plateaus
- **Source:** Pages 61-70
- **Maps to:** `tracking_system.md`

## Self-Assessment Tools

### Daily Warrior Scorecard
- **Framework:** Five-Point Daily Assessment
- **Key Insight:** What gets measured gets managed. The Daily Scorecard forces honest daily feedback on the five pillars.
- **Protocol:**
  - Each evening, rate yourself 1-5 on:
    1. Courage (Did I face discomfort?)
    2. Discipline (Did I execute my non-negotiables?)
    3. Will (Did I say no to distractions?)
    4. Mastery (Did I progress a skill?)
    5. Community (Did I give/receive support?)
  - Weekly average: Track trend lines
  - Monthly review: Which pillar is weakest?
  - Quarterly reset: Double down on weak pillars next season
- **Source:** Pages 71-90 (Daily tracking pages)
- **Maps to:** `tracking_system.md`

### The 3-Layer Challenge Diagnostic
- **Framework:** Stress Inoculation Assessment
- **Key Insight:** Comfort zones shrink if you don't regularly expand them. This tool identifies which challenge layer you're operating in.
- **Protocol:**
  - **Layer 1 (Green - Comfort):** Tasks that feel easy, no growth
  - **Layer 2 (Yellow - Challenge):** Tasks that stretch but are achievable; 70% success rate
  - **Layer 3 (Red - Heroic):** Near-impossible tasks; 20-30% success rate
  - Weekly audit: Ensure 40% of effort in Layer 2, 10-20% in Layer 3
  - Monthly check: Did comfort zone expand? (Layer 3 of last month = Layer 2 today?)
- **Source:** Pages 41-50
- **Maps to:** `stress_recovery.md`, `ngx_philosophy_expanded.md`

## Identity & Purpose

### The Warrior Identity Blueprint
- **Framework:** Values → Beliefs → Actions → Identity Loop
- **Key Insight:** You don't find identity; you build it through consistent action. The warrior is defined by what they do daily, not what they say.
- **Protocol:**
  - Define 3 core values (e.g., "Relentless Learning," "Integrity," "Resilience")
  - For each value, write 1 belief that supports it
  - For each belief, define 2-3 daily actions that prove it
  - Track actions for 90 days; identity crystallizes by day 60
  - Monthly: Audit — Are your actions aligned with your stated values?
- **Source:** Pages 11-20
- **Maps to:** `genesis_identity.md`

### Purpose Anchoring
- **Framework:** Three-Circle Overlap
- **Key Insight:** Sustainable motivation requires alignment: What you're good at, what you love, and what the world needs (or people you love need).
- **Protocol:**
  - **Circle 1 (Gifts):** List natural talents and skills
  - **Circle 2 (Passion):** Activities where you lose track of time
  - **Circle 3 (Service):** Needs of your tribe/community
  - Find the center (all three overlap)
  - Define a 90-day project that sits in that center
  - Link back to Legacy Goal

## Stress Inoculation & Resilience

### The 3-Layer Challenge System
- **Framework:** Progressive Discomfort Exposure
- **Key Insight:** Resilience is not built in comfort. Warriors systematically expose themselves to increasing stress, so they habituate to pressure.
- **Protocol:**
  - **Week 1-2:** Layer 1 challenges only (build confidence)
  - **Week 3-8:** 70% Layer 2 (growth zone) + 20% Layer 1 + 10% Layer 3 (micro-exposures)
  - **Week 9-12:** 50% Layer 2 + 40% Layer 3 + 10% Layer 1 (recovery)
  - **Tracking:** Log challenge level for each major task; plot trend (should shift right over 90 days)
  - **Quarterly:** Layer 3 of last quarter becomes Layer 2 this quarter
- **Source:** Pages 41-50
- **Maps to:** `stress_recovery.md`, `tracking_system.md`

### The Pressure Protocol
- **Framework:** Controlled Stress Exposure
- **Key Insight:** Fear loses power when you practice it. The warrior creates "safe failures" to build antifragility.
- **Protocol:**
  - Identify one fear (public speaking, confrontation, physical intensity, etc.)
  - Design micro-exposures (speak up in 1 meeting, 1 honest conversation, 1 hard workout, etc.)
  - Do it daily or weekly depending on intensity
  - Journal the outcome and emotional response
  - After 30 days, upgrade difficulty by 20%
  - Track: Fear intensity rating before/after (should decrease)
- **Source:** Pages 51-70
- **Maps to:** `stress_recovery.md`

## Community & Accountability

### The Warrior Circle
- **Framework:** Structured Accountability Model
- **Key Insight:** Isolation is the enemy of growth. The warrior operates within a circle of 3-5 accountability partners who know the mission and won't let you quit.
- **Protocol:**
  - Define your circle: Who knows your goals and will hold you accountable?
  - Weekly check-in (15-30 min): Did you execute on commitments?
  - Monthly deep dive: Progress on Heroic 100? Pillar assessment? Quarterly goals?
  - Create a "no-quit agreement" — explicit commitment to reach out if struggling
  - Rotate roles: Mentor and be mentored
- **Source:** Pages 81-100
- **Maps to:** `ngx_philosophy_expanded.md`

### Mentorship & Coaching Models
- **Framework:** One-Up, One-Down, All-Around Growth
- **Key Insight:** The warrior is always learning from someone ahead AND teaching someone behind. This creates a growth ecosystem.
- **Protocol:**
  - **One-Up (Mentee):** Find someone 2-3 steps ahead; ask 1 question per week
  - **All-Around (Peer):** Meet a peer 1x/month for honest feedback and mutual challenge
  - **One-Down (Mentor):** Coach someone 2-3 steps behind; teach what you've learned
  - **Quarterly:** Rotate mentors or deepen relationships based on results
  - **Annual:** Reflect on what you gained from each relationship
- **Source:** Pages 81-100
- **Maps to:** `ngx_philosophy_expanded.md`

### Community Rituals
- **Framework:** Shared Commitment Ceremonies
- **Key Insight:** Rituals bind communities. Public commitment (even to small circles) multiplies accountability.
- **Protocol:**
  - **Weekly ritual:** Share one win + one struggle with your circle
  - **Monthly ritual:** Group review of Scorecard data; celebrate progress
  - **Quarterly ritual:** Retreat or gathering to reset goals and deepen bonds
  - **Annual ritual:** Legacy review — Did we move closer to our 10-year vision?
- **Source:** Pages 91-100
- **Maps to:** `ngx_philosophy_expanded.md`

## Key Takeaways for GENESIS Integration

1. **Ego Clipping First:** Before users set goals, they must acknowledge weaknesses and embrace vulnerability. This is foundational.

2. **Five Pillars = Five Agent Domains:** The workbook's five pillars map naturally to GENESIS's five agents:
   - Courage ↔ TRAIN (physical courage)
   - Discipline ↔ All agents (non-negotiables)
   - Will ↔ MIND (mental will, resilience)
   - Mastery ↔ TRACK (skill progression, measurability)
   - Community ↔ GENESIS root (belonging, shared mission)

3. **Heroic 100 = Season Planner:** The 90-day cycle mirrors the 12-week season. GENESIS should ask users their Legacy Goal, Cornerstone Goals, and Quarterly Goals at season start.

4. **Daily Scorecard = Track Tab:** Implement the five-pillar daily self-assessment directly in the TRACK tab. Users rate each pillar 1-5 daily; GENESIS learns trends over time.

5. **Three-Layer Challenge = Progressive Overload:** The workout recommendation engine should use layer logic:
   - Week 1-4: Build confidence (Layer 1 + some Layer 2)
   - Week 5-8: Push harder (more Layer 2, introduce Layer 3)
   - Week 9-12: Peak (maximize Layer 3, strategic Layer 1 recovery)

6. **Warrior Circle = Social Features (Sprint 6+):** Accountability partners, peer check-ins, mentor matching — all future features but the foundation is built now via chat and notifications.

7. **Stress Inoculation Loop:** MIND agent should teach users to lean into discomfort, not avoid it. Offer micro-challenges weekly that shift users into the growth zone.

8. **Identity Anchoring:** GENESIS should periodically ask: "What are your three core values?" and then recommend actions/workouts that reinforce those values in real time.
