## SECTION 1: FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE

### Caloric Deficit Model & Theory

- **Key Data:** A caloric deficit is required for fat loss. The body's energy balance (calories in vs. out) is the fundamental driver of weight change.
- **Protocol:** Fat loss occurs when energy expenditure exceeds energy intake consistently over time.
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, foundational chapters
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md

### Rate of Fat Loss & Weight Loss Targets

- **Key Data:** Recommended rate of weight loss is **0.5-1.5% of body weight per week**
- **Protocol:** For optimal fat loss with muscle preservation, aim for slower rates (0.5-1%) rather than aggressive deficits
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, section on sustainable deficit rates
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Faster rates (up to 1.5%) are possible but increase risk of muscle loss and adherence problems

### Protein During Fat Loss

- **Key Data:** Protein intake of **1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight** is recommended during caloric deficit
- **Protocol:** Higher protein intakes (toward 2.2 g/kg) are beneficial when in larger deficits or with lower body fat percentage
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, protein recommendations section
- **Maps to:** protein_guidelines.md
- **Nuance:** Adequate protein becomes MORE critical during caloric deficit to preserve lean muscle mass

### Carbohydrate & Fat Ranges During Cut

- **Key Data:**
  - Carbohydrates: **2-3 g/kg body weight** (can go lower if needed for caloric target)
  - Fat: **0.5-1.5 g/kg body weight** (minimum ~0.5 g/kg for hormonal health)
- **Protocol:** Carbohydrate intake should support training performance; reduce calories through carbs first, then fats if needed
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, macronutrient distribution chapter
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Very low carbohydrate diets can impair training performance and adherence

### Caloric Deficit Size

- **Key Data:**
  - Moderate deficit: **300-500 kcal below maintenance**
  - Larger deficit: **500-750 kcal below maintenance**
- **Protocol:** Moderate deficits (300-500) are more sustainable and preserve muscle; larger deficits used for accelerated fat loss when time-constrained
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, deficit sizing section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Larger deficits should be shorter in duration and supported by high protein intake

### Mini-Cuts & Strategic Fat Loss Phases

- **Key Data:** Mini-cuts are 4-12 week aggressive deficit phases (500-750 kcal below maintenance)
- **Protocol:**
  1. Perform mini-cuts for short duration (4-12 weeks maximum)
  2. Follow with maintenance or lean bulk phase for 4-12 weeks
  3. Rotate between cut/maintenance rather than continuous deficit
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, strategic cutting section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Cycling between deficit and maintenance improves long-term compliance and metabolic recovery

### Maintenance Phase After Fat Loss

- **Key Data:** Maintenance calories equal total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)
- **Protocol:**
  1. After fat loss phase, increase calories back to maintenance level
  2. Maintain for 4-12 weeks before next cutting phase
  3. Allows metabolic adaptation and hormonal recovery
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, phase structure chapter
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Skipping maintenance phases increases risk of rebound weight gain and metabolic adaptation complications

### Tracking & Adherence for Fat Loss

- **Key Data:** Weekly weigh-ins show 1-2 lb (0.5-1 kg) loss per week for well-calibrated deficit
- **Protocol:**
  1. Weigh daily or 3-4x per week and track rolling averages
  2. Adjust deficit if weight loss deviates from target rate
  3. Monitor body composition (scale weight + visual/measurement changes)
- **Source:** Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple, monitoring section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md

### When to Adjust Caloric Intake During Cut

- **Key Data:** If fat loss stalls for 2-3 weeks at goal rate, reduce calories further
- **Protocol:**
  1. After 3 weeks without progress, reduce intake by 150-200 kcal
  2. Continue reduction only if previous target was not achieved
  3. Avoid aggressive reductions; small incremental adjustments only

## SECTION 2: MUSCLE GAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE

### Caloric Surplus Model & Theory

- **Key Data:** A caloric surplus (excess energy intake above TDEE) is required for muscle gain. The magnitude of surplus drives rate of gain.
- **Protocol:** Muscle gain occurs when caloric intake exceeds energy expenditure, combined with appropriate training stimulus
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, foundational chapters
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md

### Rate of Muscle Gain & Weight Gain Targets

- **Key Data:** Recommended rate of weight gain is **0.25-0.5% of body weight per week** for optimal muscle-to-fat ratio
- **Protocol:**
  - Beginners: 0.5% per week (faster gains, more fat)
  - Intermediate/Advanced: 0.25-0.5% per week (slower, leaner gains)
  - Lean bulking: Target 0.25% per week or lower
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, surplus sizing section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Faster weight gain (0.5%+) includes significant fat gain; slower rates (0.25%) are more sustainable long-term

### Caloric Surplus Size

- **Key Data:**
  - Small surplus: **300-500 kcal above maintenance**
  - Moderate surplus: **500-750 kcal above maintenance**
  - Aggressive surplus: **750+ kcal above maintenance**
- **Protocol:**
  - Beginners can tolerate larger surpluses (500-750 kcal) with good muscle gain
  - Intermediate/Advanced should use smaller surpluses (300-500 kcal) to minimize fat gain
  - Lean bulking: Use 300-400 kcal surplus for maximum leanness
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, surplus calibration chapter
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Larger surpluses do NOT produce proportionally more muscle; diminishing returns exist above 500 kcal

### Protein During Muscle Gain

- **Key Data:** Protein intake of **1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight** during caloric surplus
- **Protocol:**
  - Maintenance baseline: 1.6 g/kg minimum
  - Lean bulking: 2.0-2.2 g/kg for maximum muscle retention during deficit phases
  - Aggressive surplus: 1.6-1.8 g/kg sufficient (surplus itself drives muscle growth)
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, protein requirements section
- **Maps to:** protein_guidelines.md
- **Nuance:** Protein requirements in surplus are similar to deficit (muscle synthesis is abundant in anabolic state); priority is adequate total protein

### Carbohydrate & Fat Ranges During Bulk

- **Key Data:**
  - Carbohydrates: **3-5 g/kg body weight** (higher end supports performance)
  - Fat: **0.8-1.5 g/kg body weight** (adequate for hormones + energy)
- **Protocol:** Prioritize carbohydrates for training performance; adjust fats to hit caloric target
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, macronutrient distribution chapter
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Higher carbohydrate intake (4-5 g/kg) directly supports training volume and intensity

### Lean Bulking Protocol

- **Key Data:** Lean bulk = 0.25-0.5% weekly weight gain with emphasis on leanness
- **Protocol:**
  1. Use 300-400 kcal surplus (toward lower end)
  2. Maintain protein at 2.0-2.2 g/kg
  3. Higher carbohydrate intake (4-5 g/kg) for performance
  4. Expect 0.25% weekly weight gain (~0.5-1 lb per week for 150-200 lb person)
  5. After 8-16 weeks, mini-cut to strip excess fat gain, then repeat
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, lean bulking section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Lean bulking is slower but results in less fat regain during subsequent cuts

### Maintenance Phase for Muscle Retention

- **Key Data:** Maintenance = eat at TDEE, protein at 1.6-2.2 g/kg
- **Protocol:**
  1. After bulk phase, transition to maintenance for 4-8 weeks
  2. Allows body weight stabilization and mental break
  3. Preserves muscle while avoiding continuous fat accumulation
  4. Use as bridge phase before next cutting or bulking phase
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, phase structure chapter
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md

### Muscle-Gaining Phase Structure

- **Key Data:** Typical phase cycle = 8-16 weeks bulk, 4-8 weeks maintenance, repeat
- **Protocol:**
  1. Bulk for 8-16 weeks (0.25-0.5% weekly weight gain)
  2. Take 4-8 week maintenance or light cut to stabilize
  3. Restart bulk phase
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, long-term planning section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Continuous bulking leads to excessive fat gain; cycling improves body composition over time

### Tracking & Adherence for Muscle Gain

- **Key Data:** Weekly weigh-ins show 0.5-1 lb (0.25-0.5% of BW) per week for optimal surplus
- **Protocol:**
  1. Weigh 3-4x per week, track rolling average
  2. If gaining too slowly, increase calories by 150-200 kcal
  3. If gaining too fast (>0.5% per week), reduce by 100-150 kcal
  4. Monitor strength gains and training performance as secondary indicators
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, monitoring section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md

### When to Adjust Caloric Intake During Bulk

- **Key Data:** Adjust surplus every 3-4 weeks based on actual weight gain rate
- **Protocol:**
  1. Measure actual weight gain over 2-3 weeks
  2. If below target rate (e.g., <0.25% for lean bulk), add 150-200 kcal
  3. If above target rate (>0.5% for lean bulk), reduce by 100-150 kcal
  4. Account for glycogen/water fluctuations in short-term measurements
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, troubleshooting section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md

### Beginner vs. Advanced Surplus Sensitivity

- **Key Data:**
  - Beginners: Can gain 0.5-1 lb of muscle per week with 500-750 kcal surplus
  - Intermediate: Can gain 0.5 lb of muscle per week with 400-600 kcal surplus
  - Advanced: Can gain 0.25 lb of muscle per week with 300-400 kcal surplus
- **Protocol:** Match surplus size to training experience; less-trained individuals are more anabolic-sensitive
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, experience-based calibration chapter
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Advanced lifters experience diminishing returns on muscle gain per unit of caloric excess

### Interference Effect & Hobby Activities

- **Key Data:** High-frequency endurance/activity (mountain biking, surfing, etc.) interferes with muscle gain
- **Protocol:**
  1. If pursuing muscle gain, reduce competing physical activities to low frequency/intensity
  2. Acknowledge the "interference effect" — other vigorous activities reduce net muscle gain
  3. Choose: maximize muscle gain OR maintain hobby; cannot optimize both simultaneously
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, "Getting Exotically Huge" section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Realistic constraints on muscle gain rate come from lifestyle, not just diet/training

### Sleep & Recovery Requirements for Muscle Gain

- **Key Data:** Inadequate sleep significantly hampers muscle gain potential
- **Protocol:**
  1. Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly
  2. Sleep deprivation/inconsistency can prevent even well-designed diet/training from working
  3. Address sleep before optimizing other variables
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, "Getting Exotically Huge" section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Sleep is a non-negotiable prerequisite; optimizing diet/training without sleep is futile

### Stress Management for Muscle Gain

- **Key Data:** High occupational/life stress impairs muscle gain and recovery
- **Protocol:**
  1. Eliminate or minimize sources of chronic stress (high-stress job, lifestyle chaos)
  2. Structured sleep and nutrition are difficult to maintain under high stress
  3. Life stress is as limiting as training/diet for muscle-building goals
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, "Getting Exotically Huge" section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Muscle gain has lifestyle prerequisites beyond diet/training; context matters

### Timeline Realism for Advanced Gains

- **Key Data:** The final years of muscle gain (natty) require nearly ideal circumstances
- **Protocol:**
  1. First 1-2 years: Can gain significant muscle with reasonable discipline
  2. Years 3-5: Gains slow, require tighter diet/training consistency
  3. Year 5+: Final gains require optimal sleep, low stress, zero missed workouts, perfect consistency
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, "Getting Exotically Huge" section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Realistic expectations for advanced lifters include diminishing returns and increased difficulty

## CROSS-DOCUMENT FRAMEWORKS & CONTRADICTIONS

### The Deficit/Surplus Symmetry

- **Key Data:** Both fat loss and muscle gain require proportional macronutrient adjustments
- **Protocol:**
  - Fat loss: Protein ↑, carbs/fats ↓ to create deficit
  - Muscle gain: Protein stable, carbs ↑ to create surplus
- **Source:** Both Fat Loss and Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, macro distribution sections
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** The direction of the caloric adjustment differs, but protein requirement remains constant

### Maintenance as Metabolic Baseline

- **Key Data:** Maintenance calories (TDEE) is the reference point for all dieting phases
- **Protocol:**
  1. Establish actual TDEE through tracking (not equations)
  2. Deficit/surplus are relative to TDEE
  3. Maintenance phases between cutting/bulking reset metabolic adaptation
- **Source:** Both books, foundational sections
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Many beginners misestimate TDEE; real-world tracking is essential

### Weekly Tracking & Adjustment Cycles

- **Key Data:** Adjustments occur every 2-4 weeks, not daily
- **Protocol:**
  1. Measure actual progress (weight, strength, body comp) over 2-3 week rolling average
  2. If progress deviates from target, adjust calories by 100-200 kcal
  3. Small incremental adjustments, not aggressive cuts
- **Source:** Both books, troubleshooting sections
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Patience and consistency matter more than frequent adjustments

### The Realistic Muscle-Gain Ceiling for Naturals

- **Key Data:** Even with perfect dieting/training, natural muscle gain has hard limits
- **Protocol:**
  1. Beginners: Largest absolute gains possible
  2. Intermediate: Moderate gains, require discipline
  3. Advanced: Very small gains, require near-perfect conditions (sleep, stress, consistency)
  4. Plateau: Genetic ceiling cannot be overcome with diet/training alone
- **Source:** Muscle Gain Dieting Made Simple, "Getting Exotically Huge" section
- **Maps to:** nutrition_protocols.md
- **Nuance:** Some people claim extreme muscle gain; most are either beginners, on drugs, or miscounting. Realistic: 0.5-1 lb/week for beginners, 0.25-0.5 lb/week for intermediate, <0.25 lb/week for advanced

## INTEGRATION NOTES FOR GENESIS AI AGENTS

### FUEL Agent Application
- Use fat loss deficit/protein protocols when user is in "cutting" goal
- Use muscle gain surplus/carb protocols when user is in "bulking" goal
- Recommend maintenance phases between cutting/bulking for sustainability
- Suggest mini-cut durations of 4-12 weeks, not indefinite deficits

### TRAIN Agent Coordination
- In surplus phases: Carbohydrates 4-5 g/kg for training performance
- In deficit phases: Carbohydrates 2-3 g/kg, maintain protein to preserve strength
- Note interference effect: High-frequency cardio/other sports reduce muscle gain

### TRACK Agent Integration
- Weekly weight tracking (rolling 2-3 week average) is standard
- 0.5-1.5% weekly weight loss is optimal for fat loss
- 0.25-0.5% weekly weight gain is optimal for lean muscle gain
- Adjustments occur every 2-4 weeks, not daily

### MIND Agent Considerations
- Sleep quality is mandatory for muscle gain (non-negotiable)
- Stress management is limiting factor for advanced gains
- Acknowledge realistic timelines: faster gains in years 1-2, slower in years 5+
