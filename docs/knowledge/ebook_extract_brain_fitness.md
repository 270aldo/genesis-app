## 1. NEUROPLASTICITY

### Mechanisms & Brain Health
- **Key Data:**
  - Brain continues forming new neural connections throughout life (neurogenesis)
  - Neuroplasticity is the ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to learning or experience/injury
  - Exercise promotes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels in brain tissue)
  - Physical activity increases cerebral blood flow and oxygenation

- **BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor):**
  - Neuropeptide regulating growth, survival, and differentiation of neurons
  - Affects synaptic plasticity especially by mediating long-term potentiation
  - Key molecule in plastic changes related to learning and memory
  - Exercise upregulates BDNF expression

- **Dual Task Learning Principle:**
  - Motor and cognitive learning simultaneously strengthens brain resilience
  - Combining physical movement with cognitive challenge creates greater neural adaptation
  - Glyphatic System actively clears metabolic waste during sleep (recently discovered)

- **Protocol:** Physical + cognitive dual-tasking 3-5x/week (see Appendix A)

## 2. COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE

### Attention & Focus
- **Key Data:**
  - Attention = how much mental focus is demanded to perform a task
  - Distractions increase attention demand (auditory, visual, manual, cognitive)
  - Four sensory modes: auditory, visual, manual, cognitive
  - Distraction training improves selective attention and executive function

- **Dual-Task Cost:**
  - Performing two tasks simultaneously is more difficult than single-task
  - Task difficulty increases through novelty, volume, and pressure
  - Flow state achieved when task difficulty matches person's skills (not too easy, not too hard)
  - Stress/anxiety occurs when task too difficult; boredom when too easy

- **Protocol (Dual-Task Examples):**
  - **Physical:** Walking/cycling + cognitive task (memorization, trivia, calculations)
  - **Auditory Distractors:** Podcast/TV show, conversation comprehension, listening to instructions while moving
  - **Visual Distractors:** Observe events for recall, scavenger hunts, find/seek tasks, "I Spy"
  - **Manual Distractors:** Deal cards, fill/pour liquids, remove lids, text/email, pedaling bike
  - **Cognitive Distractors:** Remember sequences, Go-No-Go tasks, trivia, spatial reversal, spelling/reciting numbers

## 3. SLEEP SCIENCE

### Sleep Architecture
- **Key Data:**
  - Sleep has distinct phases: NREM (quiet/restful) and REM (rapid eye movement)
  - NREM characteristics: brain activity, breathing, heart rate slow down; body temperature drops; muscles relax; eye movements stop
  - REM characteristics: brain activity increases, breathing/heart rate increase, blood pressure increases, eyes move rapidly while closed
  - Circadian Rhythm: physical, mental, behavioral changes following 24-hour cycle
  - Ultradian Rhythm: biological rhythm occurring <24 hours (e.g., REM cycles)

- **REM Sleep Rebound:**
  - Compensatory increase in REM frequency, depth, intensity following sleep deprivation or significant stressors
  - Body attempts to recover lost REM sleep

- **Sleep Hygiene Protocols:**
  - Consistent sleep schedule (same bedtime/wake time)
  - Cool, dark, quiet sleep environment
  - Limit screen time 30-60 min before bed (blue light suppresses melatonin)
  - Avoid caffeine in afternoon/evening
  - Regular exercise (improves sleep quality, but not close to bedtime)
  - Manage stress through relaxation techniques
  - Avoid heavy meals before sleep

- **Glyphatic System (Brain Waste Clearance):**
  - Recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system using perivascular tunnels (astroglial cells)
  - Removes harmful interstitial metabolic waste products from brain intima during sleep
  - Most active during deep NREM sleep
  - Critical for cognitive health and neuroprotection

### Sleep & Cognition

- **Self-Efficacy for Depression:**
  - Self-efficacy = sense of confidence to complete task or achieve outcome
  - Four influences on self-efficacy (Bandura's Theory):
    1. **Performance Accomplishments** — create early wins, show progress, build mastery
    2. **Vicarious Learning** — stories of similar people overcoming obstacles
    3. **Social Persuasion** — group connection, social support, encouragement
    4. **Emotional Arousal** — words/actions of encouragement, feeling valued/successful
  - Flow State Balance (Task Difficulty vs. Skills): optimal challenge prevents anxiety (too hard) or boredom (too easy)

- **Motivational Strategies:**
  - Match programming to client's intrinsic motivations (grandkids, travel, independence)
  - Vary approaches to maximize adoption (mindfulness, exercise, cognitive training)
  - Mindset training: shift pessimism to optimism
    - Pessimists attribute setbacks to permanent traits; success to external factors
    - Optimists attribute setbacks to temporary/external; success to internal/stable traits
  - Emphasize role of client in success; build persistent mindset

### Anxiety Management
- **Key Data:**
