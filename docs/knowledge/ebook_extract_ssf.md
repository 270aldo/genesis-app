## TRAINING ADAPTATIONS

### Muscular Adaptations & Strength Development

- **Key Data:** Even very small changes in muscular development can produce significant strength improvements, especially in deconditioned populations with generalized atrophy
- **Protocol:** Slight improvements in muscle strength can substantially improve functional ability (e.g., getting up from a chair, climbing stairs)
- **Source:** Unit 12 - Strength Training Guidelines
- **Maps to:** train_agent knowledge store - Strength Training Progressions

### Progressive Overload Requirements

- **Key Data:** Clients must gradually increase weight used to benefit from strength exercises
- **Protocol:** Start with minimum weight (1-2 lbs or no weight initially); build gradually over time. Connectuve tissues need to adapt before heavier loads
- **Timeline:** Allow several weeks of initial light weight to develop perfect form and allow connective tissue adaptation before progressively increasing load
- **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174
- **Maps to:** train_agent - Progressive Overload Protocol

### Training Frequency & Recovery

- **Key Data:** Do not schedule strength exercises of the same muscle group on any two consecutive days in a row
- **Protocol:** Alternate upper and lower body exercises; allow at least one day of rest between strength training sessions
- **Recovery Timeline:** Allow several minutes recovery between sets, especially for those with degenerative neuromuscular conditions
- **Source:** Unit 12, Page 175 (Unit Summary)
- **Maps to:** train_agent - Recovery & Periodization

### Muscle Soreness vs. Overtraining

- **Key Data:** Muscle soreness lasting a few days and slight fatigue is normal after muscle-building exercises; exhaustion, sore joints, and unpleasant muscle pulling indicate overwork
- **Protocol:** Range of motion for arm and leg movements should never hurt

### Joint Mechanics & Planes of Motion

#### Frontal Plane Movements
- **Shoulder:** Abduction and Adduction
- **Hip:** Abduction and Adduction
- **Ankle:** Eversion and Inversion
- **Additional Movements:** Trunk lateral flexion/extension, Scapula retraction/protraction/depression/elevation, Scapular upward/downward rotation
- **Source:** Unit 13, Figure 13-1 - Movements in the Frontal Plane
- **Maps to:** track_agent - Movement Analysis

#### Sagittal Plane Movements
- **Elbow:** Flexion and Extension
- **Hip:** Flexion, Extension, and Hyperextension
- **Wrist:** Radial Flexion and Ulnar Flexion
- **Ankle:** Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion
- **Additional Movements:** Knee flexion/extension, Trunk flexion/extension, Shoulder flexion/extension
- **Source:** Unit 13, Figure 13-2 - Movements in the Sagittal Plane
- **Maps to:** track_agent - Movement Analysis

#### Transverse Plane Movements
- **Shoulder:** Horizontal abduction and Horizontal adduction, External/Internal Rotation

- **Additional Movements:** Elbow supination/pronation, Trunk rotation, Knee internal/external rotation
- **Source:** Unit 13, Figure 13-3 - Movements in the Transverse Plane
- **Maps to:** track_agent - Movement Analysis

### Isometric vs. Isotonic Contraction

- **Key Data:** Isokinetic exercise allows movement at fixed speed in both directions (flexion/extension)
- **Protocol:** Equipment uses accommodating resistance technology (e.g., Keiser compressed air systems)
- **Strength Imbalance Assessment:** Knee flexors should be approximately 60% the strength of knee extensors at slower velocities of movement

## FLEXIBILITY & MOTOR CONTROL

### Stretching Fundamentals

#### Optimal Conditions for Stretch Effectiveness
1. **Warm-Up Priority:** Increased tissue temperature increases viscous (plastic) property of connective tissue, resulting in greater elongation. A warm muscle stretches further than a cold one
   - **Warm-up methods:** Easy laps, walking, stationary cycling, calisthenics (5-10 minutes)
   - **Source:** Unit 13, Page 178

2. **Force Application:** Lower amounts of force induce less injury and tearing to connective tissue than high amounts
   - **Contraindication:** Vigorous or ballistic stretching may cause bleeding in joints and soft tissue tearing
   - **Source:** Unit 13, Page 178

3. **Duration:** Hold each stretch for 30-60 seconds (static/active stretching)
   - **Passive Range:** 30-60 seconds, usually 2-5 repetitions sufficient for passive range of motion
   - **Source:** Unit 13, Pages 178-180
   - **Maps to:** mind_agent - Flexibility Training

4. **Pain-Free Range:** Perform stretching through pain-free range of motion only
   - **Contraindication:** Do not stretch if pain, infection, or edema (swelling) is present
   - **Source:** Unit 13, Page 179

5. **Timing:** Incorporate stretches at end of cool-down to prevent adaptive shortening and promote muscle relaxation

#### Stretching Techniques

- **Active Stretching (Slow Static):** Slowly stretch muscle for 30-60 seconds by contracting opposing muscle group; hold at point of limitation with tension level that does not activate stretch reflex; may repeat and increase stretch over time; avoid bouncing
  - **Source:** Unit 13, Page 180

- **Passive Stretching:** Performed by trainer, moving each joint slowly through permissible range of motion; hold at point of limitation 30-60 seconds; 2-5 repetitions usually sufficient
  - **Source:** Unit 13, Page 180

- **PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation) Hold-Relax:** Utilizes both active and passive stretching
  - **Hold Phase:** 6 seconds of isometric/maximal contraction against trainer resistance
  - **Mechanism:** Golgi Tendon Organs fire, causing autogenic inhibition and muscle relaxation
  - **Relaxation Phase:** 6 seconds; repeat until no further range of motion attainable
  - **Source:** Unit 13, Pages 180-181

- **Isokinetic Exercise:** Exercises using accommodating resistance at fixed speed; allows measurement of strength imbalances; provides net effect of controlling speed of movement
  - **Source:** Unit 13, Page 181

### Contraindications for Stretching

1. Infections around a joint
2. Exacerbation of inflammatory disease, especially when pain is present
3. Edema (joint capsule subject to tears)
4. Functional contractures (e.g., finger flexors, elbow flexors, pronators may assist participant pulling objects)
- **Source:** Unit 13, Page 182

### Golgi Tendon Organs

- **Function:** Nerve sensors (proprioceptors) at junction of muscles and tendons that detect excess tension/stress on muscle and send inhibiting signals to shut off muscle contraction
- **Purpose:** May protect against separation of tendon from bone when contraction is too great
- **Source:** Unit 13, Page 181

## STRENGTH TRAINING GUIDELINES

### Safe & Beneficial Strength Training Principles

1. **Keep accurate daily records:** Record date, poundage used, and number of sets and reps performed
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

2. **Retest 1RM periodically:** If appropriate, reassess one-rep max every few weeks
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

3. **Supervision:** Supervise with a spotter (assistant) when participant is lifting weights—no matter the poundage
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

4. **Exercise Sequencing:** Alternate upper and lower body exercises so no two consecutive exercises involve same prime mover; perform larger muscle group exercises first (e.g., shoulder strengthening before wrist exercises)
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

5. **Warm-Up & Cool-Down:** Warm up before lifting, stretch afterwards
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

6. **Recovery Time:** Allow sufficient recovery time between sets (usually several minutes), especially for degenerative neuromuscular conditions
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

7. **Rest Days:** Allow client at least one day of rest between strength training sessions
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

8. **Smooth Movement:** Each repetition should be performed in smooth and controlled manner
   - **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174

### Breathing During Strength Exercise

- **Key Data:** Instruct clients not to hold their breath; remind to breathe normally
- **Contraindication:** Holding breath while straining can cause changes in blood pressure (especially critical for people with cardiovascular disease)
- **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174
- **Maps to:** train_agent - Exercise Safety

### Hip Surgery Precautions

- **Protocol:** Check with doctor before doing lower-body exercises if client has had hip repair or replacement
- **Restrictions:** Don't allow clients to cross legs; avoid hip flexion beyond 90-degree angle; avoid jerking or thrusting movements
- **Movement Quality:** Use smooth, steady movements instead; avoid "locking" joints in arms and legs into tightly straightened position
- **Source:** Unit 12, Page 174
