- **Small Intestine:** Primary site of nutrient absorption (80-90% of total absorption)
- **Colon Functions:** Water reabsorption, electrolyte balance, microbial fermentation

---

## Chapter 3: Metabolism and Energy Balance

### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Estimation
- **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation** (preferred for fitness professionals):
  - Men: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
  - Women: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161
- **Harris-Benedict Revised:** Alternative method when specific equation not available
- **BMR Calculation Note:** Results in kcal/day baseline metabolic burn

### Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
- **TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor**
- **Activity Multipliers:**
  - Sedentary (little/no exercise): 1.2
  - Light activity (1-3 days/week): 1.375
  - Moderate activity (3-5 days/week): 1.55
  - Heavy activity (6-7 days/week): 1.725
  - Very heavy (physical job + training): 1.9

### Energy Expenditure Components
- **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** 60-75% of TDEE (resting metabolism)
- **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** 8-15% of TDEE (increases with protein intake)
  - Protein: 20-30% of calories burned in digestion (highest thermic effect)
  - Carbohydrates: 5-10% of calories burned in digestion
  - Fats: 0-3% of calories burned in digestion
- **Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT):** 15-30% of TDEE (daily movement, posture)
- **Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT):** Variable, 5-10% typically

### Metabolic Adaptation
- **Adaptive Thermogenesis:** Body downregulates metabolic rate during prolonged caloric deficit (typically 10-25% reduction after 4+ weeks)
- **Weight Loss Plateau:** Common after 2-4 weeks due to metabolic adaptation and glycogen depletion
- **Recovery Protocol:** Cyclic dieting or metabolic reset phases improve long-term compliance

## Chapter 4: Carbohydrates

### Carbohydrate Classification
- **Simple Carbohydrates:** Monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) + Disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose)
- **Complex Carbohydrates:** Starches (amylose, amylopectin) + Fiber

### Glycemic Index (GI) & Glycemic Load (GL)
- **GI Scale:** 0-100 (glucose = 100 reference)
  - Low GI: < 55
  - Medium GI: 55-69
  - High GI: ≥ 70
- **Glycemic Load:** GL = (GI × grams of carbs) ÷ 100
  - Accounts for serving size impact on blood glucose

### Daily Carbohydrate Recommendations
- **Sedentary Adults:** 3-5 g/kg body weight
- **Light Activity (1-3 days/week):** 5-7 g/kg body weight
- **Moderate Training (3-5 days/week):** 6-10 g/kg body weight

- **Sedentary Adults:** 0.8 g/kg (RDA minimum)
- **Recreational Strength Training:** 1.2-1.6 g/kg/day
- **Competitive Athletes:** 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day
- **Endurance Athletes:** 1.2-1.4 g/kg/day
- **Weight Loss Phase:** 2.0-2.2 g/kg (preserves lean mass; aim for 25-30% total calories)
- **Maximum Utilization:** Evidence suggests ceiling around 2.2 g/kg; excess beyond caloric need converted to energy/storage

### Protein Distribution for Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)
- **Meals Per Day:** 3-4 meals recommended for MPS optimization
- **Protein Per Meal:** 20-40g per meal (dependent on age, training status)
  - Younger (< 40yo): 20g sufficient for MPS activation
  - Older (≥ 65yo): 30-40g recommended to overcome anabolic resistance
- **Post-Workout Window:** 1-2 hours post-exercise; MPS elevated 24-48 hours
- **Whole Protein > Amino Acids Alone:** Intact protein triggers stronger MPS response than isolated amino acids

### Protein Quality (PDCAAS/DIAAS Score)
- **Complete Proteins (all 9 EAA):** Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, quinoa
- **Incomplete Proteins:** Grains, legumes (low in lysine or methionine)
- **Protein Combining:** Grains + legumes (rice + beans) creates complete amino acid profile

- **Cardiac Health:** < 10% saturated fat, minimize trans fat
- **Athletic Performance:** 20-30% total calories (avoid excess; impairs carb absorption)
- **Deficiency Risk:** < 15% calories (compromises hormone production, nutrient absorption)

### Fat-Soluble Vitamin Absorption

## Chapter 9: Water and Hydration

### Daily Water Recommendations
- **General Population:** 15.5 cups (3.7 L) men; 11.5 cups (2.7 L) women (includes water in food)
- **Adequate Intake (AI):** 35 mL/kg body weight baseline
- **Climate/Activity Adjustment:** +10-20% in hot environments or during training

### Sweat Rate & Hydration Protocol (Athletes)
- **Sweat Rate Measurement:** Naked weight before - after exercise (in same clothing); account for fluid intake during
- **Example:** 2 kg loss during 1-hour workout = 2 L/hour sweat rate
- **Hydration Recommendation:** Drink 50-100% of sweat loss during exercise (150-250 mL/15-20 min)
  - Complete replacement often causes GI distress
  - Deliberate under-hydration helps prevent hyponatremia
- **Post-Exercise Rehydration:** 150% of weight loss over 4-6 hours (accounts for continued sweat/urine loss)
  - Example: 2 kg loss → drink 3 L over next 4-6 hours

### Fluid Types & Electrolyte Content
- **Water:** No electrolytes; sufficient for exercise < 60 minutes in cool conditions
- **Sports Drink (6-8% carbs + electrolytes):**
  - Carbohydrate: 6-8% (14-19 g/240 mL serving)
  - Sodium: 300-600 mg/L (130-260 mg per 8 oz)
  - Potassium: 60-100 mg/L (25-40 mg per 8 oz)
  - Optimal osmolality: 200-300 mOsm/kg
- **Hypertonic Drinks (> 10% carbs):** Better for post-exercise refueling; risk GI distress if consumed during exercise
- **Hypotonic/Low-Carb Drinks:** Faster gastric emptying; suitable for high-intensity or extreme heat

### Exercise Duration Hydration Guidelines
- **< 60 minutes:** Water sufficient
- **60-90 minutes:** Water with 30-60g carbs/hour + sodium (200-300 mg/hour)
- **> 90 minutes:** 30-90g carbs/hour (endurance sports tolerance) + sodium (500-700 mg/hour)
- **Ultra-Endurance (> 4 hours):** 6-8% carbs + electrolytes at max 60-90g carbs/hour (gut capacity limited)

### Hydration Status Markers
- **Urine Color:** Pale yellow (well-hydrated); dark amber (dehydrated)
- **Weight Loss During Exercise:** Aim to minimize to < 2% body weight (> 2% impairs performance)
- **Specific Gravity (Urine):** < 1.020 well-hydrated; > 1.030 dehydrated
- **Thirst:** Unreliable indicator; arrives after dehydration onset

### Hyponatremia Risk
- **Cause:** Excess water consumption without sodium (common in endurance > 4 hours or ultramarathon)
- **Serum Na+ < 135 mEq/L:** Hyponatremia (confusion, seizure, death in severe cases)
- **Prevention:** 500-700 mg sodium/hour during prolonged exercise + limit free water intake
- **Sports Drink Sodium:** 300-600 mg/L prevents hyponatremia in 3-5 hour endurance

---

## Chapter 10: Nutrient Timing & Sports Nutrition Protocols

### Pre-Exercise Nutrition (Peri-Workout)

#### Pre-Workout Meal (2-3 hours before)
- **Composition:** 3-5g carbs/kg, 0.5-1.5g protein/kg, low fat/fiber (minimize GI distress)
- **Carbohydrate Focus:** Low-to-moderate GI (oatmeal, rice, whole grains)
- **Protein:** 15-25g (muscle priming, amino acid availability)
- **Example:** 2 cups oatmeal + banana + 1 scoop whey protein
- **Purpose:** Optimize muscle glycogen, blood glucose stability, amino acid availability

#### Immediate Pre-Workout (30-60 min before)
- **Type:** Quick-digesting carbs + minimal protein/fat
- **Amount:** 15-30g carbs (sports drink, banana, energy gel)
- **Timing:** Closer to exercise = smaller portion to avoid GI upset
- **Protein:** Generally avoided at this stage (slows gastric emptying)

### Intra-Workout Nutrition

#### Carbohydrate Guidelines (By Duration)
- **< 60 minutes:** Water only (muscle glycogen sufficient)
- **60-90 minutes:** 30-60g carbs/hour (extends performance)
- **90-180 minutes:** 60-90g carbs/hour (maximizes glycogen sparing)
- **> 180 minutes:** Multiple carb sources (glucose + fructose) 90-120g/hour to overcome gut capacity limitations

#### Carbohydrate Sources (Intra-Workout)
- **High GI, minimal fiber:** Sports drinks (6-8%), gels, chews, dextrose tablets
- **Digestion Rate:** Glucose/dextrose (simplest) absorbed fastest; sucrose, maltose slower
- **Combination (Fructose + Glucose):** Allows ~90g/hour absorption (separate transporters); single-source limited to 60g/hour

#### Hydration (See Chapter 9 protocols)
- **Sodium Addition:** 300-600 mg/L (enhances fluid absorption, maintains plasma osmolality)

#### Protein (Intra-Workout) — Limited Evidence
- **Amount:** 5-10g (minimal) if used
- **Purpose:** Potential BCAA sparing; generally not necessary for sessions < 3 hours
- **Risk:** May slow gastric emptying; avoid in high-intensity sessions

### Post-Workout Nutrition (Recovery Window)

#### Immediate Post-Workout (0-30 minutes)
- **Carbohydrate:** 1.0-1.2 g/kg (80-100g for 70kg athlete)
- **Protein:** 20-40g (0.3g/kg)
- **Ratio:** 3-4:1 carbs:protein (faster glycogen resynthesis with protein co-ingestion)
- **Purpose:**
  - Glycogen resynthesis (most rapid in first 30 min post-exercise)
  - Muscle protein synthesis initiation
  - Fluid/electrolyte rehydration
- **Form:** Liquid preferred (faster absorption); whole food acceptable
- **Example:** Chocolate milk (high carb + protein + fluid), smoothie (banana + whey + juice), bagel + turkey

#### 1-2 Hours Post-Workout
- **Carbohydrate:** 1.0-1.2 g/kg (if full meal consumed here vs. immediately)
- **Protein:** 20-40g (consistent with meal timing for MPS)
- **Timing Window:** If unable to eat immediately post-workout, consume within 1-2 hours (window closes by 2 hours)

#### Glycogen Resynthesis Rate
- **With Adequate Carbs:** ~5 mmol/kg dry muscle/hour (full glycogen restoration in 24 hours)
- **Without Carbs:** ~1-2 mmol/kg/hour (glycogen depletes > restores)
- **Repeated Exercise (2nd session same day):** Minimum 4 hours between sessions; consume 1.0-1.2 g carbs/kg per 4-hour window

  - Overweight: 25.0-29.9
  - Obese Class I: 30.0-34.9
  - Obese Class II: 35.0-39.9
  - Obese Class III: ≥ 40
- **Limitation:** Does not distinguish muscle vs. fat; athletes often "overweight" by BMI

#### Waist Circumference (Central Obesity)
- **Measurement:** At level of iliac crest (hip bone); horizontal
- **Risk Thresholds:**
  - Men: > 102 cm (40 in) = increased CVD risk
  - Women: > 88 cm (35 in) = increased CVD risk
- **Value:** Predicts metabolic syndrome, diabetes risk independent of BMI

#### Skinfold Measurements
- **Method:** Calipers measure fat layer thickness at 3-7 sites (biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, abdomen, thigh, chest)
- **Accuracy:** ± 3-4% with trained technician
- **Limitations:** Operator-dependent; assumes fat distribution pattern

### Metabolic Testing

#### Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) - Indirect Calorimetry
- **Method:** O2 consumption + CO2 production measured during rest (10-30 min)
- **Output:** kcal/day (accounts for individual variation from equations)
- **Accuracy:** Most accurate metabolic assessment
- **Timing:** Fasted, rested (12-14 hours no eating, no exercise)
- **Use:** Personalized calorie targets, metabolic rate verification

#### Lactate Threshold Testing
- **Method:** Incremental exercise test measuring blood lactate at different intensities
- **Output:** Lactate Threshold Power (LTP) or Heart Rate (LTHR)
- **Use:** Endurance training zone determination (Zone 2 = below LT; Zone 3 = at LT)
- **Threshold:** Typically 4 mmol/L or LT1 (aerobic threshold ~2 mmol/L)

## Chapter 14: Dietary Guidelines & Macronutrient Distribution

### 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans

#### Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR)
- **Carbohydrates:** 45-65% of total calories
- **Protein:** 10-35% of total calories
- **Fats:** 20-35% of total calories

#### Saturated Fat & Added Sugars
- **Saturated Fat:** < 10% of total calories
- **Added Sugars:** < 10% of total calories
  - Example: 2,000 kcal = < 200 kcal from added sugars (~50g)
- **Sodium:** < 2,300 mg/day (UL); some populations benefit from lower (< 1,500 mg/day for HTN)
- **Fiber:** 25g (women 19-50), 21g (women 51+), 38g (men 19-50), 30g (men 51+)

#### Special Population Guidelines
- **Pregnancy:** +350 kcal/day (2nd/3rd trimester), iron 27 mg/day, folate 600 mcg/day
- **Lactation:** +500 kcal/day, protein 1.3 g/kg, fluids increased
- **Older Adults (71+):** Vitamin D 800 IU, vitamin B12 fortified sources/supplements
